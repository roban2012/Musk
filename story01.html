	穆斯克（Musk）干Jobs的事，但不如Jobs会忽悠。呵呵呵。另外，Steve Jobs学习能力强，成长快。读者可以看<a href= "link08.html">1985年Playboy Interview: Steven Jobs</a> 、1995 The Lost Interview以及 2005 Stanford Commencement address。比较三章，你可以看到一个美国人的成长发展。进步神速，才是奇迹。<br><br>

Geheimnis und Einbildung （Secret and Imagination）<br><br>

	伊隆 马斯克（Elon Musk，1971年6月28日- ），出生于南非的美国企业家。马斯克因身为SpaceX创办人，以及特斯拉汽车和PayPal（原X.com）的联合创办人而闻名。目前，马斯克担任Space X的执行长兼首席设计师、特斯拉汽车执行长兼产品架构师、以及SolarCity的主席；于此同时，他还是现代第一辆可行电动车-Tesla Roadster的联合设计者之一。<br><br>

	Elon Musk (1971) is a South African-American inventor and entrepreneur. He is best known for founding SpaceX and for co-founding Tesla Motors and PayPal (originally X.com). At SpaceX he is the CEO and Chief Designer and at Tesla Motors he is Chairman, CEO and Product Architect. Musk is also Chairman of SolarCity.<br><br>

	After leaving Queen's University, he went on to complete his bachelor's degree in Economics from The Wharton School, and a second bachelor's degree in Physics from University of Pennsylvania, School of Arts and Sciences<br><br>
<a href= "pic10.html">Musk</a>是Jobs第二？<br><br>
<a href= "pic11.html">Musk和他的孩子们</a>在工作室。<br><br>


马斯克生于南非的比勒陀利亚；他的母亲是加拿大籍美国人，而父亲则是南非人。他的外祖父来自于美国明尼苏达州，后来移居到了萨斯喀彻温省，他的母亲就出生在了这里。马斯克的父亲是一个工程师，母亲则是一位作家、营养师和模特。<br><br>


Musk is a native of South Africa, born in 1971 to parents who later divorced. His father was an engineer and his mother―originally from Canada―was a nutritionist. Musk was fascinated by science fiction and computers in his adolescent years. When he was twelve, he wrote the code for his own video game and actually sold it to a company. In his late teens, he immigrated to Canada in order to avoid the required military service for white males in South Africa. It was still the era of apartheid, the South African legal system that denied political and economic rights to the country's majority-black native population. Musk was uninterested in serving in the army, which was engaged at the time in a battle to stamp out a black nationalist movement. Thanks to his mother's Canadian ties, he was able to enroll at Queen's University in Kingston, one of Ontario's top schools. <br><br>

 


马斯克在自己10岁那年买了第一台计算机，并自学了编程。12岁时，以500美金出售了自己的第一个名为Blastar(一个太空小游戏)的商业软件。17岁（1988年）高中毕业后，没有父母的资助，部分原因是因为义务兵役，离开了家庭。<br><br>

1992年，在皇后大学学习两年后，离开了加拿大，转而到宾夕法尼亚大学学习商业和物理；在从宾夕法尼亚大学的沃顿商学院毕业，获得学士学位后，又留校一年，获得第二个物理学士学位。马斯克考虑了三个最想涉足的领域，这三个领域在他看来都是深刻影响人类未来发展的领域，分别是：互联网，清洁能源，太空。<br><br>

Musk was born and raised in Pretoria, South Africa, the son of a Canadian mother, Maye (née Haldeman), and a South African father, Errol Musk.  His mother's heritage include Pennsylvania Dutch;[8] his maternal grandfather was from Minnesota, and had moved toSaskatchewan, where Musk's mother was born. His father is an engineer and his mother is an author, nutritionist and model,[9]appearing on the cover of New York Magazine in 2011 and Time Magazine in 2010.<br><br>

Musk bought his first computer at age 10 and taught himself how to program;[10] by the age of 12 he sold his first commercial software for about $500, a space game called Blastar.[10]

After matriculating at Pretoria Boys High School he left home in 1988 at the age of 17, without his parents' support and in part because of the prospect of compulsory service in the South African military: "I don't have an issue with serving in the military per se, but serving in the South African army suppressing black people just didn't seem like a really good way to spend time".[10] He wanted to move to the US, saying: "It is where great things are possible".<br><br>

In 1992, after spending two years at Queen's University, Kingston, Canada, Elon left Canada, pursuing business and physics at theUniversity of Pennsylvania on a full scholarship. From the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, he received an undergraduate degree in Economics, and stayed on another year to finish a second bachelor's degree in Physics.[12] His undergraduate degrees behind him, and drawing inspiration from innovators such as Nikola Tesla,[13] Musk then considered three areas he wanted to get into that were "important problems that would most affect the future of humanity", as he said later, "One was the Internet, one wasclean energy, and one was space". <br><br>

InterestsMusk has described himself as a workaholic who routinely invests 100 hours per week running Tesla Motors and SpaceX, often flying in a fuel-efficient corporate jet. <br><br>

The SpaceX factory was used as a filming location for Iron Man 2 and Musk has a cameo in the movie.[65] In addition, Jon Favreau, director of the Iron Man movies, describes in his article how Musk was the inspiration for Favreau's film depiction of genius billionaire Tony Stark.<br><br>

Musk previously owned and later sold a McLaren F1 sports car and a Czech made jet trainer aircraft Aero L-39.[66] The 1994 model Dassault Falcon 900 aircraft used in the filmThank You for Smoking is registered to Musk (N900SX)[67] and Musk had a cameo as the pilot of his plane, opening the door for Robert Duvall and escorting Aaron Eckhartaboard.<br><br>

Musk is an attendee of the Burning Man festival, and says that he first thought up the idea for SolarCity at the 2004 festival.[36] Recently, he proposed a solar-powered jet tunnel system known as the Hyperloop that would enable individuals to make trips from San Francisco to Los Angeles in less than 30 minutes.<br><br>




PR作了工作，现在变成这样：<br><br>


Musk was born in Pretoria, South Africa to a Canadian mother, Maye (nee Haldeman), and a South African father, Errol Musk. <br><br>

Elon taught himself how to code and program software, and by the age of 12 he sold his first software―a space game called Blastar―for about $500. <br><br>

After spending two years in grades eight and nine at Bryanston High School, Musk matriculated at Pretoria Boys High School. He left home in 1988 at the age of 17 to avoid military service in the South African military as serving to defend Apartheid was a concern: "I don't have an issue with serving in the military per se, but serving in the South African army suppressing black people just didn't seem like a really good way to spend time."  He wanted to move to the US, saying: "It is where great things are possible." <br><br>

In 1992, after spending two years at Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Musk left Canada, pursuing business and physics at the University of Pennsylvania. Choosing to major at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania,  he received an undergraduate degree in Economics, and from University of Pennsylvania, School of Arts and Sciences,  he received a second bachelor's degree in Physics.  He then moved to the Silicon Valley area of California to undertake a PhD in Applied Physics and Materials Science at Stanford. He did not finish that degree. His undergraduate degrees behind him, and drawing inspiration from innovators such as Thomas Edison, Nikola Tesla, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and Walt Disney,  Musk then considered three areas he wanted to get into that were "important problems that would most affect the future of humanity", as he said later, "One was the Internet, one was clean energy, and one was space." <br><br>


ZIP2（在线内容出版软件）<br><br>

1995年，马斯克到斯坦福大学学习材料科学和应用物理的硕士课程；但，只待了了两天，就辍学，和他弟弟一起开始了一个Zip2的项目（一个为新闻机构开发的在线内容出版软件）。1999年，Compaq的AltaVista的部门以3.07亿美元现金和3400万美元股票期权收购了ZIP2。<br><br>

Musk went on to a graduate program in both applied physics and materials science at Stanford in 1995. He stayed two days before dropping out to start Zip2, which provided online content publishing software for news organizations, with his brother Kimbal Musk. In 1999, Compaq's AltaVista division acquired Zip2 for US$307 million in cash and US$34 million in stock options.<br><br>

PayPal<br><br>

他与人合伙创办了PayPal网上付费机制，让网上的消费者既安全又方便地付费，成为迄今最成功的网上付费方式。<br><br>

2002年10月，他以15亿美元的价格将PayPal转卖给了全球最大的网上商店――电子港湾(eBay)。
<br><br>
Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company, in March 1999. One year later, in a 50/50 merger, X.com acquired Confinity, which operated an auction payment system similar in size to X.com, namely PayPal. Musk was instrumental in organizing the purchase due to his belief in emerging online transfer or "P2P" technology.[16] Musk believed that the Confinity sub-brand would become the necessary vehicle to incorporate and develop a person-to-person payment platform within X.com. The combined company at first adopted X.com as the corporate name, but in February 2001, X.com changed its legal name to PayPal Inc. Musk was instrumental in the new PayPal’s focus on a global payment system and departure from the core financial offerings of X.com.<br><br>

PayPal’s early growth was due in large part to a successful viral growth campaign created by Musk. In October 2002, PayPal was acquired by eBay for US$1.5 billion in stock. Before its sale, Musk, the company's largest shareholder, owned 11.7% of PayPal's shares.<br><br>


SpaceX <br><br>

2002年6月，马斯克创立了自己的第三家公司：SpaceX（space exploration technologies）并兼任CEO和CTO；SpaceX一家雄心勃勃的私人太空发射公司，近期目标是月球，远期目标当然是火星，他要直接和美国国家航空航天局(NASA)以及全球各国的太空发射中心抢生意。<br><br>

从一开始，Space X的宗旨就是简单，这样既能保证最大的安全性，也能节省成本。“猎鹰1号”采用了全新的、节能型引擎，在过去30年里，美国只研制出两种火箭引擎，因而“猎鹰1号”的引擎设计是从一张白纸开始的。这种引擎的最大特色在于使用高纯度煤油作为燃料，另外，它可以随时关闭，这使得工程师在控制台上就能遥控关闭火箭引擎，而传统的火箭引擎，一旦点燃后就不能“回头”了。“猎鹰1号”火箭有两节，分别配备两个引擎，它的第一节采用硬壳式结构，由铝合金制成；节间段和整流罩都由碳化纤维制成，降低了材料质量；第二节是罐结构，由铝锂合金制成。<br><br>





整个火箭的设计简单到不能再简单，即使这样，整个设计时间还是历时3年半，其间经历了不少挫折。SpaceX尽管是太空发射领域的一家小公司，但凭借一流的创新技术，获得了NASA的16亿美金的合同，为NASA承担12次太空发射任务。2012年5月25日，SpaceX发射了一枚两级火箭，将一艘名为龙飞船的太空飞船送向国际空间站（ISS），更是开启了太空私营化的时代。<br><br>


Musk founded his third company, Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX), in June 2002 and is the CEO and CTO. SpaceX develops and manufactures space launch vehicles with a focus on advancing the state of rocket technology. The company's first two launch vehicles are the Falcon 1 and Falcon 9 rockets and its first spacecraft is Dragon.<br><br>

SpaceX was awarded a $1.6 billion NASA contract on 23 December 2008, for 12 flights of their Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft to the International Space Station, replacing the Space Shuttle after it retired in 2011. Initially, Falcon 9/Dragon will replace the cargo transport function of the Shuttle and astronaut transport will be handled by the Soyuz. However, SpaceX has designed Falcon 9/Dragon with astronaut transport in mind and the Augustine commission has recommended that astronaut transport be handled by commercial companies like SpaceX.<br><br>

Musk views space exploration as an important step in expanding―if not preserving―the consciousness of human life. Musk has said that multiplanetary life may serve as a hedge against threats to the survival of the human species. "An asteroid or a super volcano could destroy us, and we face risks the dinosaurs never saw: An engineered virus, inadvertent creation of a micro black hole, catastrophic global warming or some as-yet-unknown technology could spell the end of us. Humankind evolved over millions of years, but in the last sixty years atomic weaponry created the potential to extinguish ourselves. Sooner or later, we must expand life beyond this green and blue ball―or go extinct." Musk's goal is to reduce the cost of human spaceflight by a factor of 10.  He founded SpaceX with $100 million of his early fortune. He remains chief executive officer and chief technology officer of the Hawthorne, Calif.-based company.<br><br>

In seven years, SpaceX designed the family of Falcon launch vehicles and the Dragon multi-purpose spacecraft from the ground-up. In September 2009, SpaceX's Falcon 1 rocket became the first privately funded liquid-fuelled vehicle to put a satellite into Earth orbit. NASA selected SpaceX to be part of the first program that entrusts private companies to deliver cargo to the International Space Station. This contract, which has a minimum value of $1.6 billion and a maximum value of $3.1 billion, has become a cornerstone of the Space Station's continued access to cargo delivery and return. In addition to these services, SpaceX's goals include simultaneously lowering the price of orbital spaceflight and improving reliability, both by an order of magnitude, while creating the first fully reusable orbital launch vehicle. In the coming years, Musk will focus on delivering astronauts to the International Space Station, but has stated his personal goal of eventually enabling human exploration and settlement of Mars. In a 2011 interview, he said he hopes to send humans to Mars' surface within 10C20 years. On 25 May 2012, the SpaceX Dragon vehicle docked with the ISS, making history as the first commercial company to launch and dock a vehicle to the International Space Station.<br><br>



Tesla Motors<br><br>


马斯克是特斯拉汽车的合伙创始人和总设计师，并带领设计了电动汽车Tesla Roadster。他对电动汽车的兴趣始于Tesla创立之前。很早以前他去斯坦福作应用物理和材料科学的博士学位，目标就是研发出超级电容器能够给电动汽车提供足够能量。<br><br>

特斯拉汽车公司的第一款电动跑车Tesla Roadster，已在31多个国家销售超过2300辆。<br><br>





特斯拉还为戴姆勒Smart EV 和奔驰A系提供电动动力系统，为丰田RAV4提供电动系统。马斯特还成功让两家公司作为特斯拉汽车公司的长期投资者。<br><br>

特斯拉是主要负责总体经营战略，旨在向大众市场的消费者提供负担得起的电动汽车。截至2012年3月他在特斯拉享有32%的股权，价值10亿美元。<br><br>

Musk is a co-founder and currently head of product design at Tesla Motors. Musk's interest in electric vehicles extends long before the creation of Tesla.<br><br>

Musk lead the Series A investment in Tesla Motors, which had been incorporated 9 months earlier by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, who financed the company until the Series A round. The Series A round included investment by several smaller investment groups, including SDL Ventures and Compass Technology Partners. As a result of the financial crisis in 2008 and a forced layoff at Tesla,  Musk was forced to assume the additional responsibility of CEO.<br><br>

Tesla Motors first built an electric sports car, the Tesla Roadster, with sales of about 2,500 vehicles to 31 countries. Tesla began delivery of its four-door Model S sedan on 22 June 2012 and unveiled its third product, the Model X, aimed at the SUV/minivan market, on 9 February 2012. Model X is scheduled to begin production in 2014. In addition to its own cars, Tesla sells electric powertrain systems to Daimler for the Smart EV and Mercedes A Class, and to Toyota for the upcoming electric RAV4. Musk was also able to bring in both companies as long-term investors in Tesla.<br><br>


Musk is principally responsible for an overarching business strategy that aims to deliver affordable electric vehicles to mass-market consumers. His vision was to create the Tesla Roadster as a means to that end―a car aimed specifically at affluent early adopters, whose purchase of the sports car would subsidise the research and development costs of lower priced models of electric vehicles. From the start of Tesla, Musk has been a champion of the Model S, a four-door family sedan with an anticipated base price of half that of the Roadster. Musk has also favoured building a sub-$30,000 subcompact and building and selling electric vehicle powertrain components so that other automakers can produce electric vehicles at affordable prices without having to develop the products in house. Several mainstream publications have compared him with Henry Ford for his revolutionary work on advanced vehicle powertrains.<br><br>

He is reported to have a 32% stake in Tesla, which is currently valued above $12 billion, as of 29 May 2013.<br><br>


To overcome long-range limitations in the electric car market, Musk said in an interview with All Things D in May 2013 that Tesla is “dramatically accelerating” their network of supercharger stations, tripling the number on the East and West coasts during the month of June, with plans for more expansion across North America, including Canada, throughout the year.<br><br>

SolarCity <br><br>

马斯克规划了SolarCity的最初轮廓，并是最大的股东和董事会主席。SolarCity是美国最大的太阳能发电系统供应商。特斯拉创立SolarCity的基本动机为了帮助遏制全球变暖。<br><br>

Musk provided the initial concept for SolarCity, where he remains the largest shareholder and chairman of the board. SolarCity is the largest provider of solar power systems in the United States. His cousin Lyndon Rive is the CEO and co-founder. The underlying motivation for funding both SolarCity and Tesla is to help combat global warming. In 2012, Musk announced that SolarCity and Tesla Motors are collaborating to use electric vehicle batteries to smooth the impact of rooftop solar on the power grid.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T2">天生的生意人</a> </b><br>
	<hr>
	
穆斯克在34岁那年，身价就超过了3亿美元，他似乎是个天生的生意人，从小就懂得如何利用自己的条件和机会去变换美元。<br><br>


他在南非出生，父亲是一名南非的工程师，母亲是加拿大人，从事营养师和模特工作。在他们看来，穆斯克从小就与其他的孩子不一样。“当别的孩子望着月亮，感叹它与地球有多远时，艾隆会说，实际上它与地球的平均距离为38万4400公里。”母亲梅・穆斯克笑着说。<br><br>
显然，穆斯克有自己的世界。10岁那年，穆斯克拥有了自己的第一台电脑，并且学会了软件编程。两年后，他成功设计出一个名叫“Blastar”的游戏，并为这款商业软件开出了500美元的价格。<br><br>
这个被身边人称为“天才”的孩子，在17岁那年去了加拿大，而他的最终梦想地则是美国，他说：“那是一个把不可能的事情变成可能的地方。”1992年，他靠奖学金进入了宾夕法尼亚大学，终于站在了美国的土地上。<br><br>
每个人大学毕业之时，往往都要做自己的职业规划，但是没有一个人能像穆斯克做得如此出色。他当时的职业理想是要进军三个自认为在未来将非常重要的领域――互联网、清洁能源和空间。如今看来，这三个理想，在他不满40岁时就已统统实现。<br><br>
随后，带着自己的资金积累，穆斯克创建了SpaceX和Solar City两家公司，并担任它们的CEO。而令穆斯克最终成名于世界的是他2004年所做的一桩生意――向马丁・艾伯哈德(Martin Eberhard)创立的特斯拉公司投资630 万美元，而他则担任该公司的董事长。<br><br>
特斯拉公司是一家制造高端电动跑车的公司，穆斯克对它投资显然是基于对电动汽车的热爱以及看好这个市场。但是因为管理问题以及第一款跑车出产过程的磕磕绊绊，这桩生意险些让从未失手的穆斯克翻了船。<br><br>
幸好，穆斯克是个不错的舵手。2010年6月，特斯拉成功完成IPO，净募集资金约1.84亿美元。公司股票在纳斯达克证券市场挂牌交易，使它成为自1956年福特汽车IPO以来第一家上市的美国汽车制造商，也是目前唯一一家在美国上市的纯电动汽车独立制造商。<br><br>
穆氏特斯拉<br><br>
谁会如此疯狂，在当时大汽车生产商(例如通用、福特、丰田)全都终止了自己的电动汽车项目，宣布电动车已死亡的背景下，他开始投入大笔资金进入电动汽车行业？<br><br>
2004年的一天，马丁・艾伯哈德带着他的电动车计划向穆斯克寻求投资。两个小时的谈话后，穆斯克准备当这个疯狂之人。随后，他为特斯拉公司注入了大量的资金和心血。<br><br>
他们为这个雄心勃勃的事业制定了一个三步走战略。第一步，开发高端、高性能的运动型电动汽车，证实电动汽车既酷又可行性，以吸引第一批目标顾客：有环保意识的高收入人士、注重公众形象的社会名流；第二步是开发能与奔驰、宝马等豪华品牌竞争的电动轿车；第三阶段是推出价格能被普通大众接受、可以大规模推广的低成本经济型电动汽车。<br><br>
按照这个计划，特斯拉开始设计并制造Tesla Roadster敞篷跑车。令人没有想到的是，穆斯克和艾伯哈德在第一步“战略”都未走完时，合作关系就开始出现破裂。<br><br>
在艾伯哈德看来，穆斯克在公司的进程中越来越像一个专权主义者，他经常在毫无预告的情况下改变公司决策。设计之初，他认为Roadster跑车底盘的车门踏板较高，上车时容易发生磕碰，命令工程师把车门踏板降低两英寸，结果让用经过碰撞测试的现成底盘所节省的成本全都浪费。艾伯哈德建议采用 Elise 跑车所使用的玻璃纤维车身面板，但穆斯克却坚持要求使用碳纤维，他觉得碳纤维更轻、更耐用，也更时髦。随后，他又要求重新设计了大灯、汽车门锁，换了定制的座椅和仪表盘。<br><br>
随着时间的推移，公司开始意识到按照原定投产的日期是不可行了。而原本计划卖10万美元的跑车，其成本已经大大超过原先设想的6.5万美元。2007 年 12 月，在穆斯克的策划下，创始人艾伯哈德被赶出董事，CEO一职由穆斯克担任。<br><br>
虽然惹怒了艾伯哈德，并且大大推迟了产品的投产时间，但第一批7辆Roadster跑车总算成功地在2008年初进行了交付。也正因为有了穆斯克当初设计时的吹毛求疵和坚持，才使得Roadster跑车有了如今的完美表现。<br><br>
据Kevin Yu给出的最新数据，截至目前，已有2100余辆Roadster跑车驰骋在31个国家的道路上，行驶里程已超过1800万英里。<br><br>
担任CEO的穆斯克还是坚持他一贯的硬派作风，而Roadster跑车取得的成功更是使他自信满满。2010年，他成功地将特斯拉的股票挂在纳斯达克证券市场上，并且在花了420万美元在加州的弗里蒙特为公司找到了制造工厂――新联合汽车制造厂(Nummi)，它曾经为丰田和通用公司共同使用。<br><br>
2011年11月，穆斯克在接受彭博社的电视采访时表示，特斯拉预计明年投产的续驶里程高达483km的新款Model S四门电动跑车还没生产，其6500份订单就已经被全部订购。<br><br>
特斯拉公司2010年第四财季净亏损为5140万美元，到了2011年第三季度，亏损有所改善，但仍有3490万美元。七年来，它已经烧掉了2.3亿美元投资，但只创造了1.48亿美元营收。不过穆斯克信心满满，就像他在特斯拉上市路演中说的那样，“在底特律不敢赌注有朝一日路上跑的汽车都将由电池驱动，而特斯拉已经把这认定为不远的未来。”<br><br>
新款Model S四门电动跑车的推出，是穆斯克他们当初提出的第二步战略，如果这一步走得够稳，那推出“价格能被普通大众接受、可以大规模推广的”低成本经济型电动汽车也就指日可待。<br><br>
 相关事件<br><br>
民营航天时代开启人<br><br>
美国太空探索技术公司于5月22日成功发射了“猎鹰9”号火箭，将 “龙”飞船送上国际空间站，这是人类向空间站发射的首艘商业飞船。由他的SpaecX公司发射成功。“龙”飞船的升空，其意义不仅是为国际空间站提供物资补给商业服务，更重要的是提供航空员往返服务。太空探索技术公司正在研发飞船内生命维持和安全系统，以实现载人飞行任务，接送航天员往返国际空间站。穆斯克的SpaceX与美国宇航局签署了一项价值16亿美元的合同，为后者运载货物至国际空间站，需要进行12次发射。<br><br>
PayPal的创始人<br><br>
1995年，穆斯克和他的兄弟金伯尔・穆斯克(Kimbal Musk)成立了Zip2。在获取巨额回报后，穆斯克又联合创立了X公司，一个在线金融和邮件支付服务公司。它后来与另一家公司Confinity合并，改名为PayPal。2002年，ebay用15亿美元股票收购了PayPal，如今它成为了全球最大的在线支付平台。<br><br>
 婚姻史<br><br>
穆斯克不仅以理性才华著称，而且还享有花花公子的名声。2008年他在伦敦某夜总会认识了当时23岁的英国女星妲露拉・莱莉，穆斯克深为妲露拉所倾倒，他在相识不到一个月就向妲露拉求了婚。但两人已于2012年1月离婚。相对于第二次离婚可能比第一次离婚要容易些，穆斯克的第一场婚姻所谓是闹得沸沸扬扬的离婚众人皆知，其前妻、大学时代的恋人贾斯廷（Justine）两人共有五个儿子（一对7岁的双胞胎外加5岁的三胞胎），现在与其前妻共同享有五个儿子的监护权。<br><br>


野心家穆斯克<br><br>

2012年02月17日 张慧<br><br>
 

即便在奇人辈出的硅谷，穆斯克的个性依然足够鲜明。如今，他正企图推动特斯拉电动跑车从概念走向大众。<br><br>

继2005年拍摄纪录片《谁杀死了电动车》后，美国导演克里斯 佩恩带着新片《电动车的复仇》于2011年11月登陆加州影院，宣告电动车的回归。在这些“复仇者”中，特斯拉公司(Tesla Motors)生产的电动跑车――敞篷跑车(Tesla Roadster)绝对算得上最具魅力的角色之一。<br><br>

这款穿着莲花Elise外衣的电动跑车，外形俊俏，0到96公里每小时加速只需3.7秒，续航里程达到320公里，废气排放则为0。<br><br>

而同这辆车一样耀眼绚丽的是他的主人艾隆 穆斯克(ELon Musk)。大多数早晨，他都会驾驶着自己的红色跑车，从位于加州富豪区Bel-Air的豪宅中出发，驶向帕洛阿尔托市(Palo Alto)斯坦福研究园的一幢大楼。这里是特斯拉公司的总部， 门口上方的大“T”型标志像这儿的主人一样往外散发张力和生机。<br><br>

如今，穆斯克面对的是一个已拥有1400名员工和电动汽车生产基地的上市公司，目前市值超过29亿美元。而他同时又担任着另外两家公司的CEO。这两家公司，一家是太阳能系统服务公司，一家则是私营火箭公司，目标是向国际空间站输送旅客。<br><br>

Kevin Yu是特斯拉亚太区总裁，他对《能源》记者说：“穆斯克的远见卓识和雄心，注定要给世界上一些大产业带来变革，比如汽车制造业和空间高技术产业。”在外人看来，穆斯克现在所做的事情，都是目前的高端新兴产业，极炫、极酷、极前卫，充满了理想主义色彩。<br><br>

天生的生意人<br><br>

穆斯克在34岁那年，身价就超过了3亿美元，他似乎是个天生的生意人，从小就懂得如何利用自己的条件和机会去变换美元。<br><br>

他在南非出生，父亲是一名南非的工程师，母亲是加拿大人，从事营养师和模特工作。在他们看来，穆斯克从小就与其他的孩子不一样。“当别的孩子望着月亮，感叹它与地球有多远时，艾隆会说，实际上它与地球的平均距离为38万4400公里。”母亲梅?穆斯克笑着说。<br><br>

显然，穆斯克有自己的世界。10岁那年，穆斯克拥有了自己的第一台电脑，并且学会了软件编程。两年后，他成功设计出一个名叫“Blastar”的游戏，并为这款商业软件开出了500美元的价格。<br><br>

这个被身边人称为“天才”的孩子，在17岁那年去了加拿大，而他的最终梦想地则是美国，他说：“那是一个把不可能的事情变成可能的地方。”1992年，他靠奖学金进入了宾夕法尼亚大学，终于站在了美国的土地上。<br><br>

每个人大学毕业之时，往往都要做自己的职业规划，但是没有一个人能像穆斯克做得如此出色。他当时的职业理想是要进军三个自认为在未来将非常重要的领域――互联网、清洁能源和空间。如今看来，这三个理想，在他不满40岁时就已统统实现。<br><br>

1995年，穆斯克和他的兄弟金伯尔?穆斯克(Kimbal Musk)成立了Zip2。在获取巨额回报后，穆斯克又联合创立了X.com，一个在线金融和邮件支付服务公司。它后来与另一家公司Confinity合并，改名为PayPal。2002年，ebay用15亿美元股票收购了PayPal，如今它成为了全球最大的在线支付平台。<br><br>

随后，带着自己的资金积累，穆斯克创建了SpaceX和Solar City两家公司，并担任它们的CEO。而令穆斯克最终成名于世界的是他2004年所做的一桩生意――向马丁 艾伯哈德(Martin Eberhard)创立的特斯拉公司投资630 万美元，而他则担任该公司的董事长。<br><br>

特斯拉公司是一家制造高端电动跑车的公司，穆斯克对它投资显然是基于对电动汽车的热爱以及看好这个市场。但是因为管理问题以及第一款跑车出产过程的磕磕绊绊，这桩生意险些让从未失手的穆斯克翻了船。<br><br>

幸好，穆斯克是个不错的舵手。2010年6月，特斯拉成功完成IPO，净募集资金约1.84亿美元。公司股票在纳斯达克证券市场挂牌交易，使它成为自1956年福特汽车IPO以来第一家上市的美国汽车制造商，也是目前唯一一家在美国上市的纯电动汽车独立制造商。<br><br>

穆氏特斯拉<br><br>

Geheimnis und Einbildung （Secret and Imagination）<br><br>


谁会如此疯狂，在当时大汽车生产商(例如通用、福特、丰田)全都终止了自己的电动汽车项目，宣布电动车已死亡的背景下，他开始投入大笔资金进入电动汽车行业？<br><br>

2004年的一天，马丁 艾伯哈德带着他的电动车计划向穆斯克寻求投资。两个小时的谈话后，穆斯克准备当这个疯狂之人。随后，他为特斯拉公司注入了大量的资金和心血。<br><br>

他们为这个雄心勃勃的事业制定了一个三步走战略。第一步，开发高端、高性能的运动型电动汽车，证实电动汽车既酷又可行性，以吸引第一批目标顾客：有环保意识的高收入人士、注重公众形象的社会名流；第二步是开发能与奔驰、宝马等豪华品牌竞争的电动轿车；第三阶段是推出价格能被普通大众接受、可以大规模推广的低成本经济型电动汽车。<br><br>

按照这个计划，特斯拉开始设计并制造Tesla Roadster敞篷跑车。令人没有想到的是，穆斯克和艾伯哈德在第一步“战略”都未走完时，合作关系就开始出现破裂。<br><br>

在艾伯哈德看来，穆斯克在公司的进程中越来越像一个专权主义者，他经常在毫无预告的情况下改变公司决策。设计之初，他认为Roadster跑车底盘的车门踏板较高，上车时容易发生磕碰，命令工程师把车门踏板降低两英寸，结果让用经过碰撞测试的现成底盘所节省的成本全都浪费。艾伯哈德建议采用 Elise 跑车所使用的玻璃纤维车身面板，但穆斯克却坚持要求使用碳纤维，他觉得碳纤维更轻、更耐用，也更时髦。随后，他又要求重新设计了大灯、汽车门锁，换了定制的座椅和仪表盘。<br><br>

随着时间的推移，公司开始意识到按照原定投产的日期是不可行了。而原本计划卖10万美元的跑车，其成本已经大大超过原先设想的6.5万美元。2007 年 12 月，在穆斯克的策划下，创始人艾伯哈德被赶出董事，CEO一职由穆斯克担任。<br><br>

虽然惹怒了艾伯哈德，并且大大推迟了产品的投产时间，但第一批7辆Roadster跑车总算成功地在2008年初进行了交付。也正因为有了穆斯克当初设计时的吹毛求疵和坚持，才使得Roadster跑车有了如今的完美表现。<br><br>

据Kevin Yu给出的最新数据，截至目前，已有2100余辆Roadster跑车驰骋在31个国家的道路上，行驶里程已超过1800万英里。<br><br>

担任CEO的穆斯克还是坚持他一贯的硬派作风，而Roadster跑车取得的成功更是使他自信满满。2010年，他成功地将特斯拉的股票挂在纳斯达克证券市场上，并且在花了420万美元在加州的弗里蒙特为公司找到了制造工厂――新联合汽车制造厂(Nummi)，它曾经为丰田和通用公司共同使用。<br><br>

2011年11月，穆斯克在接受彭博社的电视采访时表示，特斯拉预计明年投产的续驶里程高达483km的新款Model S四门电动跑车还没生产，其6500份订单就已经被全部订购。<br><br>

特斯拉公司2010年第四财季净亏损为5140万美元，到了2011年第三季度，亏损有所改善，但仍有3490万美元。七年来，它已经烧掉了2.3亿美元投资，但只创造了1.48亿美元营收。不过穆斯克信心满满，就像他在特斯拉上市路演中说的那样，“在底特律不敢赌注有朝一日路上跑的汽车都将由电池驱动，而特斯拉已经把这认定为不远的未来。”<br><br>

目前特斯拉在全球共有32个直营销售据点，分别为美洲18个、欧洲10个与亚洲4个。据Kevin Yu透露，中国市场也是特斯拉未来关注的主要市场之一，更有消息称，特斯拉在中国国内也已有专业团队取得其代理权。<br><br>

新款Model S四门电动跑车的推出，是穆斯克他们当初提出的第二步战略，如果这一步走得够稳，那推出“价格能被普通大众接受、可以大规模推广的”低成本经济型电动汽车也就指日可待。 <br><br>


野心家穆斯克<br><br>

	<b><a name="T3">创业者Elon Musk的一天</a> </b><br>
	<hr>
	
欧开磊    2012/07/25<br><br>

Elon Musk可以说是目前世界上最励志的企业家和创业者。<br><br>

1999年，Musk联合创立了一个在线进入和邮件支付服务公司X。一年后，X和Confinity合并，2001年公司改名为PayPal，2002年，ebay以15亿美元的价格收购了PayPal，收购前，Musk是PayPal最大股东，拥有11.7%的股份。<br><br>

之后他将自己从收购中赚到的钱投入到自己经营的两家公司中去，两家正在改变世界的公司：电动汽车生产商Tesla和私营太空公司SpaceX。不久前，SpaceX发射的私人航天飞船Dragon与国际太空站顺利对接后成功返回地球。Telsa也是一家拥有32.1亿美元市值的上市公司，公司最新推出的高性能电动汽车Model S备受外界瞩目。此外，他还是居家太阳能板公司SolarCity的董事长。<br><br>

Musk获得了巨大的成功，因此很多人都开始好奇他每天都是怎么过的，有没有什么和常人不一样的地方。为了满足众人的好奇，他 透露了自己每天的工作安排并附上了图片。他将自己的时间平分给自己经营的两家公司。他周一和周四会待在位于洛杉矶的SpaceX公司总部，周二和周三会在Tesla。周五则会在两家公司来回跑。<br><br>

早晨，他开着自己的Model S前往SpaceX办公室<br><br>



早上10点：打一些早晨需要处理的公务电话。今天，他给SpaceX的营销副总裁Katherine Nelson打了电话。通常情况下，他早晨打电话的对象一般是记者、应聘者或有关SpaceX或Tesla的会议电话。<br><br>



早上10点45：Musk和SpaceX的工程师团队开了一次会议，讨论的主题是猎鹰9号运载火箭。他的助理告诉我们，这是每周必开的一次会议，主要对猎鹰9号进行状态评估，因为这和SpaceX未来的航天发射密切相关。<br><br>



这就是猎鹰9号，可不是什么玩具啊，是真正的运载火箭，因此这些会议非常重要。<br><br>



12点30：推进安排会议，会议议程包括发动机的生产以及目前用于飞行测试的各种发动机的研发情况。<br><br>



午餐时间：Musk吃的是鸡肉、蔬菜和沙拉。通常情况下，他会从附近的餐馆打包回公司吃。在今天的午餐会议上，他和公司的设备人员谈了一些有关设备开发和改进的情况，以及未来航天的需求。<br><br>


在去火箭工厂的路上，他漫步走过SpaceX的工程师办公区间。<br><br>



在SpaceX的每一天，Musk都会到火箭组装工厂去。今天下午4点半，他又去那里进行了巡视。<br><br>



今天晚上7点，科技博客PandoDaily的Sarah Lacy采访了他。图片显示他正在等待接受采访。<br><br>



之后，他与电影Baseball in the Time of Cholera制作团队进行了合影，他是这部电影的监制。<br><br>



好了，这就是世界上最励志的企业家和创业者Elon Musk的一天。<br><br>


华尔街日报最近称美国出现了一件“创造历史”的事件。一家私人公司 SpaceX，成功发射了一个火箭，搭载着名为“Dragon”的宇宙飞船飞往国际空间站，并成功地进行对接。这是历史上第一次由私人公司发射火箭，承担地面与太空之间物资运送的责任。<br><br>

SpaceX 一时间收到很多祝福之声，包括 Google 的 Larry Page、Tim O’Reilly 等等。<br><br>

然而，这不是一次偶然得来的成功。创立 SpaceX 的是 Elon Musk，PayPal 创始人。在 2002 年 10 月正式将公司卖给 Ebay 之前，也就是 2002 年 6 月，由他个人出资一亿美元，创立了这家降低人类从地面到太空成本为目标的公司。一亿美元，当时是他财产的大半，从他人的角度来看，创立 SpaceX 几乎就是一场豪赌。<br><br>



为什么 Elon 对外太空如此热衷？他是 Mar Society 的长期会员，这是一家对探索火星提供支持的非公益性组织，著名的国际导演卡梅隆也是该组织的会员之一。在 2011 年 Mars Society 报道了 Elon 的雄心，“我以后将上百万人送往火星”。对外太空浓厚的兴趣与激情，相信是他创立 SpaceX 后，一直全力前进的动力。<br><br>

一家公司从无到有，独立研发可发射升空的火箭，Elon 面对过诸多困难。2006 年，公司开发的 Falcon 1 火箭首次仅仅发射一秒之后，因为燃料管破裂而失败；2007 年，公司再次试射 Falcon 1，火箭因为自旋稳定的问题，导致传感器关闭了火箭引擎而失败；2008 年，公司再次进行试射 Falcon 1，这次再次遭遇到失败，因为新设计的冷却系统的问题；直到第四次试射，也就是 2008 年 9 月 28 日，Falcon 1 才第一次发射成功；在 2009 年，进行第五次试射也取得了成功――SpaceX 的技术在失败中逐步走向成熟。<br><br>

在接受华尔街日报采访时，他透露 2007 年到 2009 年，是“一生中最糟糕的两年”――Falcon 1 的试射失败，与此同时他有可能和 Sean Parker 一样，被迫离开自己创立的另外一家公司 Tesla Motors，更糟糕的是他妻子还要与他离婚。所幸的是，这一切他都熬过来了。<br><br>

SpaceX 所研发的 Falcon 9，也就是以这一次成功将“Dragon”运往国际空间站的火箭型号，研发费用仅仅 3 亿美元；与之相对比，美国的 EELV 火箭的研发费用高达 35 亿美元。不仅如此，SpaceX 的发射费用仅为 5400 万美元，而在美国火箭发射市场占据垄断地位的 ULA 其 4 次发射费用报价 17.4 亿美元，平均每次发射需 4.35 亿美元。<br><br>

他的另外一家公司 Tesla Motors，以研发生产电力汽车为目标，今年生产的新车型 Model X 受到消费者的欢迎，预订量达 10000 辆。不仅如此，他还投资的太阳能生产商 SolarCity 自 2007 年开始，便是美国加州最大的太阳能上生产商。<br><br>

这三家公司，Tesla Motor 已经成功上市，SolarCity 上个月爆出上市计划，SpaceX 的上市也是板上钉钉的事――也就是说从 2002 年开始到 2012 年这十年期间，Elon 一共成功的创立了三家上市公司，这样的成就是非常了不起的。无怪乎有人将他视为现实版的“Tony Stark”。<br><br>

<a href= "link01.html">《钢铁侠》（英语：Iron Man）</a><br><br>

在十年间创立三家上市公司？Elon 如何做到的？在 2009 年他曾经透露，自己每周工作一百小时，当时的语气有点无奈：<br><br>


如果你每周花一百个小时在某件事情上，它就很难成为乐趣。每周八十个小时，我可以管理一个不断发展的事业，但一百个小时，它开始侵蚀你的睡眠时间和家庭时间，让日子变得艰难。<br><br>

但是，我相信 Elon 没有放弃每周工作一百个小时的做法，否则 SpaceX、Tesla Motor、SolarCity 这些公司都将难以获得成功。<br><br>

他不愧是最富于激情的企业家之一。<br><br>

	<b><a name="T4">穆斯克和贝索斯：下一个生态系统的建造者</a> </b><br>
	<hr>
	
特斯拉汽车（tesla motors）创始人埃伦・穆斯克（elon musk）一定感觉这就像是甜美的辩解。<br><br>

米特・罗姆尼（mitt romney）在第一场总统竞选辩说中把特斯拉公司称为“掉败者”。不到两个月后，特斯拉model s被《motor trend》和《汽车杂志》（automobile magazine）双双评为年度车型，打败了宝马和法拉利等汽车巨子。<br><br>

正如杰森・卡拉坎尼斯（jason calacanis）在其为科技博客网站pandodaily撰写的最新文章中所言，穆斯克的斗胆打算被鼓噪声所袒护。他筹算在美国成立超等充电站收集，以便为特斯拉汽车供给电力。<br><br>

今朝，加州已建好6座超等充电站。到来岁，若是一切顺遂的话，特斯拉汽车的驾驶者们将可以在坦帕到多伦多、纽约到洛杉矶再到旧金山和周边的线路上充电。<br><br>

穆斯克仍是solarcity公司的董事长，恰是这家公司负责为特斯拉汽车制造价钱廉价、易于安装的太阳能充电站，是以他正在进行使人恋慕的垂直整合。大体上来讲，他是在高价卖车、免费充电，与惠普备受鄙夷的低价卖打印机、靠墨盒赚钱的方式判然不同。<br><br>

并且，这些超等充电站向电网返还的电力比耗损的电力还要多，是以穆斯克可以靠发电创收。我认为，超等充电站还能供给进阶发卖的机遇，也就是在这些路边超等充电站发卖食物、咖啡、太阳镜、游戏、电子产物和儿童玩具。因为行驶150英里需要充电半个小时（300英里需要一个小时），是以驾驶者和乘客们必需找点工作做来消磨时候。<br><br>

我感觉，餐馆、歇息室、电子游戏厅、健身房、美黑沙龙、小型购物中间等场合将呈现在这些超等充电站四周，是以穆斯克还可以进行招商。<br><br>

就像atm收集一样，穆斯克还可以向那些驾驶其他公司出产的电动汽车的人收取充电费，若是电动汽车风行起来的话，这将在今后发生大量的副业收入。这最终有可能成为实际。<br><br>

所有这些意味着，穆斯克可以或许节制整个生态系统，锁定那些在今后采办其零排放汽车的顾客。<br><br>

这听起来有点耳熟，如同是另外一位拥有前瞻性思惟的企业家正在做的工作。我说的就是亚马逊的杰夫・贝索斯（jeff bezos）。<br><br>

人们很少会把埃伦・穆斯克和杰夫・贝索斯等量齐观。<br><br>

除了两人都很富有之外，他们仿佛没有几多配合点，最少从概况上看是如斯。一个想要成为运输业富翁，几近把整幅身家都押在了奔向太空的事业上，另外一个因为一家在线零售巨子而著名于世，拥有加倍现实的追求。 摘自福布斯)<br><br>

	<b><a name="T5">民营航天时代启幕背后的富豪：艾伦・穆斯克</a> </b><br>

福布斯中文网<br><br>
这是加州洛杉矶高档住宅区贝莱尔（Bel Air）的一个周四的早晨，脸颊上刚敷过须后水的埃伦・穆斯克（Elon Musk）回到设在地下室的家庭影院里。他把自己这幢建筑面积达20,000平方英尺、彰显法国新艺术风格的豪宅改造成了适合谈生意或娱乐的男人窝。<br><br>

真皮沙发及刻有元素周期表的茶几就是他事实上的工作站。每当在午夜过后发送完大量电子邮件，或对诸如堪称“人类迄今最佳隔热板”的酚碳热烧蚀板（Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablator）等课题进行一番研究之后，他便喜欢来到这里休息片刻。这位现年40岁的亿万富豪是电动汽车制造商特斯拉公司（Tesla）以及太空探索技术公司SpaceX的创始人，SpaceX是使太空飞行器成功进入太空轨道的首家私营公司。当世界上其他所有人都开始醒来时，他并没有拖着疲惫而沉重的步伐前往办公室，而是在教我如何玩《生化奇兵》（BioShock），这是一款类似艾恩・兰德（Ayn Rand）小说风格的第一人称视角射击游戏巨作。<br><br>

穆斯克双眼凝视着屏幕，解释说：“这款游戏告诉我们，黑格尔的辩证法决定了历史的进程。可以说他们是相互冲突的哲学或者相互竞争的文化基因组，你可以看看现代历史，当中不存在如此多相互斗阵的遗传学问题，简直像是一场文化基因结构间的战争。”<br><br>

是的，他就是这样说的，虽然这时的他正在玩电子游戏。<br><br>

游戏玩了90分钟。特斯拉公司正准备针对那些具有环保意识的“足球妈妈”（泛指家住郊区、已婚、并且家中有学龄孩子的中产阶层女性，她们花费大量时间用于接送孩子参加体育或其他娱乐活动）发布一款运动型多用途汽车（SUV），并且将在7月份推出一款新的轿车；同时SpaceX正忙于测试其“龙号”（Dragon）太空船与国际空间站的对接。虽然他这两家公司的工作都无不令人心驰神往，但穆斯克显然喜爱这样的消遣，他挤出更多的时间陪我参观了一下这幢房子。<br><br>

这幢占地1.6英亩的豪宅位于一座幽僻的山顶上，俯瞰太平洋，内设一座网球场（穆斯克的弟弟金伯尔开玩笑说，他俩偶尔一起打网球，但因两人都很争强好胜，因此他每次打赢一球之后，都得逃走），一个室外游泳池，还有一条小径通向一棵大树――穆斯克计划在上面建造一间树屋。要知道，他可是五个男孩的父亲――一对7岁的双胞胎外加5岁的三胞胎。房子里面是一样的豪华，配有预料之中亿万富豪拥有的所有气派华贵的豪华家居，下至宽敞的酒窖也是如此，而主浴室的空间非常大，穆斯克在里面安设了一台跑步机。<br><br>

然而，我感觉眼前这一切似乎还缺点什么，对了，是其他家人在家里的任何迹象。在天花板挑高的书房里，一排排白色的书架尴尬地“裸站”在那里――上面空无一书（穆斯克完全通过iPhone手机来体现他对阅读的如饥似渴，他最近阅读的两本书是《富兰克林自传》<The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin>及沃尔特・艾萨克森撰写的《乔布斯传》<Steve Jobs>）。<br><br>

泳池被遮盖了起来，修剪整齐的后院里看不到任何玩具、露天椅子或烧烤架。男孩子们都在学校――穆斯克经历了一场被媒体炒得沸沸扬扬的离婚，现在与其前妻、大学时代的恋人贾斯廷（Justine）共同享有五个儿子的监护权。他的第二任妻子是现年26岁的英国女演员妲露拉・莱莉（Talulah Riley），据说目前在英国拍电影。整幢房子里没有任何有女性居住的迹象――衣服、鞋子、化妆品。甚至没有任何私人照片可言，哦，除了有一张私人照片之外。那是一张3英尺的全景照片：穆斯克和莱莉在某个偏僻的热带海滩上观看月食，身后是一艘私人游艇，他俩手臂交缠，一起微笑地仰望着天空。另一面墙上挂着一个相框，里面放着随相框一起奉送的一张椅子的照片。<br><br>

我问穆斯克是否养狗。他回答说，是的，有两条狗。但我没看到任何狗盆、牵狗的皮带或者狗咬棒。他告诉我说，这幢房子已连同家具一起租出去了。换句话说，虽然穆斯克住在这里，但要把这称为他的家，便未免有夸张之嫌了。现在，这幢房子只是他生活中的一个驿站，一个大玩反乌托邦电子游戏的安乐窝。<br><br>

穆斯克身高1米86，肩宽腿长――显然腿长与他的名字很相称（“Elon”是“橡树”的希伯来文，虽然穆斯克家族来自宾夕法尼亚州的荷兰裔族群，并非犹太人）。他给他那辆深红色的Tesla Roadster双座敞篷电动跑车充足了电――他没有选择那辆奥迪Q7或保时捷911，准备开车20英里，前往位于洛杉矶西南霍桑市（Hawthorne）的SpaceX公司总部。开上405号高速公路之后，他体贴地设置好最适合这款敞篷跑车的温度与风力，设好混搭着英国流行天王罗比・威廉姆斯（Robbie Williams）、格莱美宠儿阿黛尔（Adele）的歌曲及贝多芬第五交响曲的播放列表，冷静地驾车飞驰在路上。他做上述这一切的举止，完全反映出他给公众留下的那种感觉――一个像机器人似的天才，活脱脱就是电影《钢铁侠》（Iron Man）主角托尼・斯塔克（Tony Stark）的现实版。<br><br>
  
 他赢得的这个声誉有大部分可以说是当之无愧的。<br><br>

穆斯克的母亲梅伊（Maye）回忆说：“在他小时候，如果我带上三个孩子一起逛街，而埃伦突然不见了的话，那么他一定‘被落在’书店里了。他会坐在地上，完全沉浸在自己的世界里。当他只有八九岁的时候，他就读完了整部大英百科全书，而且还记住了里面的内容！”梅伊虽然已经63岁，但仍然是一名非常吃香的时装模特（她最近裸体上阵，化妆成孕妇，效仿黛米・摩尔那张经典的孕妇裸照，为《纽约》杂志拍摄了一张封面照）。<br><br>

埃伦在南非比勒陀利亚长大，那时由于他总爱指出同学们确实存在然而并不重要的错误，因此同学们都疏远了他。他以为自己是在帮助他们，但同学们则认为他很自大，并且以欺负他作为回应。<br><br>

“他可以坦诚到残忍的地步，无论在什么情况下，哦，上帝啊，这真的很令人受伤的，”他的妹妹托斯卡（Tosca）说，“他其实并不想显得刻薄，或故意让你感觉不舒服。而且他欣赏坦诚以待。”<br><br>

到读大学的时候，穆斯克在宾夕法尼亚大学攻读物理学和经济学，然后在获得上述两个专业的学士学位之后，进入斯坦福大学就读应用物理学及材料科学的研究生课程（但只做了两天的学生就退学创业了）。大学时代的他在身体上是成熟了，但他直率而又呆板的性格丝毫未变，而且把这种性格用于他的研究之中，以至于梅伊认为有必要时常去看看他，以确保他每天至少吃点东西，并换穿双新袜子。他在宾夕法尼亚大学读书时的室友、自身也是高科技创业者的阿迪奥・莱西（Adeo Ressi）说，“跟大学时代比起来，穆斯克已更有亲和感了。现在，他会开玩笑了。”<br><br>

上班路上，穆斯克开着这辆用莲花跑车改造的座驾，从车厢地毯上拿起万宝龙飞行员太阳镜戴上，然后就他最喜欢驾车飞驰的公路（毫不奇怪，他喜欢的是1号高速公路）、他最喜欢的音乐（如果不是在听罗比・威廉姆斯的摇滚音乐，那么他更像是披头士和平克・弗洛伊德的经典摇滚音乐的粉丝）、他最喜爱的汽车（1967年的捷豹E-Type超级跑车“就像一个野蛮女友，非常乖张”）款款而谈。<br><br>

我问他：“你可曾但愿自己生活在另一个不同的时代呢？”<br><br>

穆斯克回答说：“不，我很高兴自己生活在当下这个时代。”话音中显露出他仍带有的南非那种抑扬顿挫的口音。<br><br>

“为什么？”<br><br>

“如果有人认为自己宁愿生活在另一个不同的时代的话，那么他们很可能没有认真学习历史。以前的生活很糟糕。人们懂得的知识很少，而且你很可能因某种可怕的疾病而夭折。而到你现在这个年纪，你很可能牙都掉光了。倘若你是女性的话，那就尤其糟糕了。”<br><br>

说得好。<br><br>

“如果你穿越到几百年以前，那么我们如今认为理所当然的东西似乎就会变得像是魔法一样神奇――能够与千里之外的人对话、传输图像、飞行、像神谕者那样获得巨量信息。这些都是几百年前会被认为是魔法的事情，”他说，“因此，从所有实际角度来讲，工程学就是魔法，而谁又不想成为魔法师呢？”<br><br>

几乎自从他在斯坦福当了两天学生之后就退学以来，穆斯克一直是他这一代人当中最杰出的魔法师之一。在1995年，他和弟弟金伯尔联合创办了为新闻机构提供网络发布软件与服务的Zip2公司，之后在1999年将该公司以3.07亿美元现金外加价值3,400万美元的股票期权出售给康柏公司。<br><br>

然后，他在1998年与别人联合创办了贝宝（PayPal），并于2002年初上市；穆斯克是该公司最大的股东，直至那年晚些时候该公司被电子港湾（eBay）以15亿美元收购。他的名望随着自己获得的成功而日隆：当他和莱莉在2010年结婚时，拉里・佩奇（Larry Page）和谢尔盖・布林（Sergey Brin）据说把“谷歌号”私人飞机借给他们度蜜月。穆斯克和莱莉成为好莱坞最热门派对及周末高雅消遣的常客。<br><br>

在过去的十年里，他加倍施展其魔法，设法把电动汽车及私营太空产业同时打造成切实可行的商业企划。特斯拉总部设在帕洛阿尔托（Palo Alto），因此穆斯克乘坐自己的达索猎鹰商用喷气式飞机（Dassault Falcon）在两家公司之间每周往返两次（特斯拉公司的设计仓库就在附近，在SpaceX厂区后面）。<br><br>

投资者似乎并不介意穆斯克同时兼顾两家公司的做法：特斯拉公司以2.261亿美元的估值成功首次公开募股（IPO）。2011年，该公司总营收达2.04亿美元（净亏损2.54亿美元，相比2010年少亏损1亿美元）。穆斯克拥有特斯拉公司约29％的股份，该公司从未盈利，但目前市值已远超过30亿美元。<br><br>


尚未上市的SpaceX公司是穆斯克在2002年利用贝宝出售给eBay所兑现的资金而创立的。该公司已赢得了发射卫星的合同，价值超过10亿美元，并计划于今年4月份开始向国际空间站运输货物。穆斯克表示，他很可能会在明年将该公司推上市。在过去的一年里，他的净资产大幅增长，从8亿美元猛增至20亿美元，从而使他在2012年的福布斯全球富豪榜上赢得一席之地。<br><br>

在路上行驶了30分钟之后，我们便到达了SpaceX公司。如果你不甚了解这家公司的话，那么我可以告诉你，它看起来就像是个电影片场，甚至还有托尼・斯塔克身穿钢铁战甲、真人大小的塑像，以及一家冰淇淋店，那里有一些工程师大叔排队在给免费的软圣代冰激凌撒浇头配料。这里的墙壁装饰要比穆斯克在出租的那幢房子更加引入注目：他指给我看一张前纳粹分子沃纳・冯・布劳恩（Wernher von Braun）的肖像，他曾倡导美国宇航局（NASA）实施阿波罗登月计划，并把我拉到一幅巨大的火星照片跟前，那是他梦想开拓移民的地方，并指导我找到火星上著名的“水手号大峡谷”（Valles Marineris）。不过，真正的展示发生在生产车间，在那里，圆锥形的“龙号”太空船静待与国际空间站“相约对接”的日子。<br><br>

穆斯克身边都是地球上有史以来最棒的玩具。他返回到自己的办公室――实际上是一间巨大的半开放型转角办公室，因为SpaceX和特斯拉公司都支持开放式办公空间的理念。他抓起一把剑，剑柄裹以黄貂鱼皮革，这把剑是他因在商业领域的一系列成就而获得的一件奖品。他开始持剑左右挥舞。“你真的可以用这把剑刺伤别人，”他说，“我在设法让它发出嗖嗖的声音，不会伤害到任何人。”<br><br>

我举起一张纸，当作他的靶标，穆斯克果然守诺，没有伤到我，然而也没有切断那张纸，而是把它从我的手中震脱了出去。随后他把目标转向附近那盆“坚忍而无辜”的盆栽植物，以首席工程师所具有的那种精确度切下几片叶子，总算一报雪耻，扳回些面子。<br><br>

穆斯克不仅以理性才华著称，而且还享有花花公子的名声――他曾****，身穿休闲西服，头戴非洲式蓬松假发，纵情跳舞狂欢；包下纽约市所有的俄罗斯夜总会，在内华达州黑岩沙漠充分体验那里一年一度的反传统狂欢节――“火人节”。他年轻、英俊、靠自己的努力而获得成功并发家致富，拥有在任何夜总会hold住对方的手段，包括伦敦那家夜总会――在2008年他就在那里认识了当时23岁的妲露拉・莱莉。所以，在好莱坞的一个周五的午夜时分，我仍等待穆斯克给我发短信，这便不足为奇了。<br><br>

我们的提议是，他将和他的一群朋友一起，向我展示他生活里的那个洛杉矶――当拥有无限财富而且进入任何地方都畅通无阻的时候，这座“天使之城”会是怎样。对此我们一整天互发短信。但根据他最新发来的短信得知，他正在私人会所苏荷馆（Soho House）与他的密友――《钢铁侠》导演乔恩・法夫罗共享一顿清净的晚餐。他发短信告诉我说：“之后我们可以在比佛利山庄酒店或其他地方喝点东西。”<br><br>

但是，到了12:30，他感觉有点不太舒服：“刚离开苏荷馆。我在回家的路上，感觉非常累。今天一早就和孩子们一起起床了，所以没睡多少觉。”然后又发来一条短信：“现实情况是，近来我很少去俱乐部。在过去12个月里只去过两次，都是因为朋友硬拖我去的。”
<br><br>
当时我正在离比佛利山庄酒店几英里之外的好莱坞罗斯福酒店里的酒吧里，和朋友们一起等他。于是，朋友中就有人调侃我，说我“被辣妹拼掉了”（hot-chicked）――这是目前洛杉矶流行的一句隐语，意思是约会对象被更有吸引力的漂亮女孩抢走了，但这听起来不像是真的。后来，我偶然听到别人说，那天晚上的确在苏荷馆看到穆斯克和法夫罗在一起――就像穆斯克告诉我的那样。而且在之前的三个月里，他一直诚心诚意地回复我的每一个电话、电子邮件和短信。<br><br>

他确实和我中断联系过一次。连续三周，一直延续到圣诞节和元旦，他除了通知我取消一次拍照之约之外，完全没有和我联系。他似乎归隐到那幢租出去的“男人窝”里，进入长时间冬眠了。<br><br>

1月17日深夜，他发出的一条推特短消息解释了这一切：“@rileytalulah 和你在一起的四年真是无限美好。我将永远爱你。总有一天你会使某个人非常快乐。”<br><br>


一看到他这条宣布和第二任妻子分手的消息之后，我便给他发了一份电子邮件。10分钟后，就在他那里早上7点的时候，从分手的伤痛中回过神来的穆斯克给我打来电话。他平静地说：“我在感情上真的很难接受和她分手这件事情。”听着他这番话，我感觉似乎并不是如此：难过，是的，但也活得好好的。“基本上可以说，我已不再爱她了，好像有点很难回到过去。”他说，把这个消息公布于众之后，分手的痛苦似乎减轻了，因为在过去几个月里，越来越明显，他和莱莉无法继续下去了。<br><br>

事实证明，莱莉已经有好几个月没有和穆斯克一起生活在洛杉矶了。根据法庭文件，是她提出离婚的。<br><br>

穆斯克的第二次离婚可能比第一次离婚要容易些。2008年那场闹得沸沸扬扬的离婚众人皆知，结果他把那年称作是自己一生中最艰难的一年。他的第一任妻子贾斯廷没有对本文提出的采访要求予以回应。贾斯廷在时尚杂志《玛丽-克莱尔》（Marie Claire）上叙述了他俩的婚姻问题：“那些帮助他获得非凡成就的个人品质同样也决定了你和他一起过的生活完全是他的生活……而且丝毫没有妥协折中的余地（尤其是因为他没有时间去寻求妥协）。”埃伦・穆斯克对此基本上保持沉默。<br><br>

他是否仍然相信爱情呢？他的回答是：“是的，毫无疑问。”虽然他目前并不知道如何或在哪里能找到爱情。他心目中的那个她所要具有的品质是：无私、勤奋、现实，但这些似乎与他以前那种好莱坞夜总会式的生活方式并不搭调。<br><br>

如果他找不到爱情怎么办？“那将很可悲，因为那样的话，我会非常孤单。”<br><br>

今年2月份，穆斯克的两个世界――好莱坞和硅谷――汇聚到了一起。他在特斯拉公司的霍桑设计仓库里主持新款特斯拉SUV的发布派对。穆斯克已聘请洛杉矶独立流行乐队Foster the People表演节目（三天后，他们将在格莱美颁奖典礼上表演），近2,000人参加了这场发布派对，其中包括从时尚人士到风险投资者，从电影《美国队长》（Captain America）的明星演员克里斯・埃文斯（Chris Evans）到加州州长杰瑞・布朗（Jerry Brown）等名流政要，宾客们吃着龙虾，喝着凯歌香槟（Veuve Clicquot），大声要求与穆斯克分享片刻时光。<br><br>

身穿深蓝色丝绒运动夹克及深色牛仔裤的穆斯克站上舞台，他其实讲述了一个笑话，虽然这个笑话是有关页岩油气开采的水力压裂技术。（“世界迫切需要可持续型的交通工具。如果我们本世纪不解决这个问题的话，那么我们都要被‘水力压裂’了！”）之后他冷静地站在那里注视着，几名设计师正竭尽全力，试图打开那辆SUV的前盖（里面的装置太多了。他向他们提示说：“或许前盖安全闩卡住了”）。那晚他待得很晚，期间似乎只喝水。周围许多女性要求与他合影，他都饶有兴趣地与她们摆出拍照姿势――似乎并没有特别关注任何人。其中有一半的时间，他坐在角落里的沙发上，身边围着一群身穿运动外套及休闲便鞋而衣着入时的男士。<br><br>

这个晚上对穆斯克而言至关重要，他高调宣称这款配有“鹰翼车门”的SUV是集小型货车（实用性）、奥迪Q7（气派）及保时捷911（性能）的优点于一身的理想组合，而且顺理成章是他将在今年夏天开始销售的Model S电动轿车（售价为50,000美元）的后续产品。他需要一款热销汽车：特斯拉公司拥有高达36亿美元的市值，但只卖出2,000辆左右的Roadster双座敞篷跑车（该款汽车已停产）。<br><br>

然而，他似乎很轻松，就像我曾看到的那样。 这款SUV以及即将推出的轿车都已有许多等候购买的客户了，而他轻松地流露出他私人生活的那种思路清晰的感觉。两天后的早晨，我再次来到他的豪宅，这次他家里非常活跃。那天恰是星期六，所以孩子们都从学校回家了，穆斯克和他的五个儿子吵闹地玩着一种类似躲避球的游戏，他们称之为“躲过球”（他和他的大学室友莱西已开始把各自的孩子带到约塞米蒂国家公园参加“与老爸宿营”活动）。<br><br>

同时，我带着一大批摄影工作人员，其中包括三名摄影助理，一名化妆师，一名时尚指导，再加上一名金发碧眼的法国女性――她被派来专门照看穆斯克将在拍照时戴在手上的价值35,090美元的帕玛强尼（Parmigiani）手表。出乎意料的是，穆斯克还蛮接受这款手表的。就在那周的早些时候，我们曾给他进行过一次拍照，那次他曾当即表示不同意采用汤姆・福特（Tom Ford）、乔治・阿玛尼（Giorgio Armani）、拉夫・劳伦（Ralph Lauren）等品牌为他量身定制的服饰。<br><br>

“你必须找别的服饰来替代，”当时他向造型师郑重说到， “我不想看起来像是个校园男孩。这不是我的风格。”<br><br>

他最终对我们挑选的搭配感兴趣了，甚至当场就买了几件。而现在，他正高兴地穿戴上我们要求他穿戴的所有服饰，而且在更换服饰的时候，还在用口哨的方式吹着西纳特拉（Sinatra）的歌曲。<br><br>

在我去机场的路上，我通过电子邮件感谢他的款待以及把我们所有人都介绍给他的孩子们认识。他迅速给出的回复可谓是一如既往的简单扼要：“不客气。现在生意很好，孩子们也很好。只是我自己需要解决爱情方面的问题（或者出家去当和尚）。”<br><br>

几个小时之后，他也将赶往机场，乘坐他的达索猎鹰商用机迅速飞赴旧金山，参加一个朋友的生日聚会，迎接感悟新生活的又一天。<br><br>

埃伦・穆斯克：颠覆式创新的“极客”富豪<br><br>
21世纪经济报道 正道 2013-04-19 	<br><br>

如果你还不知道埃伦・穆斯克（Elon Musk），要么是你对金钱的嗅觉不够敏感，要么是你太不够关注高风险刺激的新领域。<br><br>

对金钱嗅觉够敏感的，一定会发现，即使在再创新高的美国股市，一家名叫特斯拉汽车（Tesla Motors）的公司股价也远远跑赢大市，并且貌似还在获得更多投资人的追捧。而埃伦・穆斯克便是这家公司的创始人兼CEO。<br><br>

对高风险领域关注的，更是早早会在过往10年以下几个领域看到过埃伦・穆斯克的名字，它们包括：电子支付、光伏、太空火箭以及上面提及的电动汽车――埃伦・穆斯克在这些行业虽然不是最具创新能力的人，但一定是最能将创新转化为商业价值的“极客（Geek）式”企业家。<br><br>

在创新战略研究者看来，埃伦・穆斯克是典型的颠覆式创新者的代表，他的突出特质便是一个人能够将异想天开的天马行空思维与脚踏实地的组织运营管理集于一体。某种程度上，他也许会是下一个“乔布斯”。<br><br>

生日礼物<br><br>

再过2个月，埃伦・穆斯克即将迎来他42岁的生日。但他已经在生日之前给自己的商业客户与拥趸们一堆礼物。<br><br>

根据最新的预测，特斯拉汽车（Tesla Motors）有望在2013年一季度由亏转盈，这也是这家股价屡创新高的公司首季度盈利。他在南非出生，父亲是一名南非的工程师，母亲是加拿大人，从事营养师和模特工作。在他们看来，穆斯克从小就与其他的孩子不一样。“当别的孩子望着月亮，感叹它与地球有多远时，艾隆会说，实际上它与地球的平均距离为38万4400公里。”母亲梅・穆斯克笑着说。<br><br>

致力于建造可重复利用的火箭进行太空旅行的SpaceX公司也宣布，在德克萨斯州新建太空舱计划获得了巨大进展，普通人完成自己星际旅程的梦想也许会越来越可行。这家公司也是埃伦・穆斯克所创立的。<br><br>

至于他在光伏领域的棋子――SolarCity，一家集太阳能电池板与系统的设计、安装及相关消费金融于一体的公司――也表现不错。<br><br>

要知道，在过去几年，诸如电动汽车滞销、全球光伏业所获补贴大幅缩减以及美国宇航局（NASA）预算削减等事件，让外界想当然认为这3家公司所处的是前景悲观的产业。<br><br>

可是也正是这3年，埃伦・穆斯克所创立并参与管理的这三家公司，让他个人大赚特赚，并首次进入了2012《福布斯》富豪榜，根据杂志的估算，当时他的个人财富有20亿美元。<br><br>

与很多“极客”在拥有财富后，依旧宅在实验室，或者跑到拉斯维加斯让金钱如化学试剂般迅速化为烟雾不同，这些财富在埃伦・穆斯克手里得到了最好的去处。<br><br>

在《福布斯》杂志记者对他的一次采访中的描述，埃伦・穆斯克住在一座占地1.6英亩的豪宅，位于一个幽僻的山顶上，俯瞰太平洋，内设一座网球场，一个室外游泳池，还有一条小径通向一棵大树――穆斯克计划在上面建造一间树屋。要知道，他可是五个男孩的父亲――一对7岁的双胞胎外加5岁的三胞胎。房子里面是一样的豪华，配有预料之中亿万富豪拥有的所有气派华贵的豪华家居，下至宽敞的酒窖也是如此，而主浴室的空间非常大，穆斯克在里面安设了一台跑步机。<br><br>

而埃伦・穆斯克喜欢在设在地下室的家庭影院里处理一些和工作相关的事务，比如采访，再比如回电子邮件。真皮沙发及刻有元素周期表的茶几就是他事实上的工作站。<br><br>

没错，他的确和许多商业富豪的生活没什么两样，适度的享受让他能够在紧张的商场厮杀中对冲一下。但是，这并不是他的财富主要去处，事实上，他一直将大量的金钱继续投入在他的事业，和对很多高风险领域探索创新中。<br><br>

要知道，在10年之前，他便拥有亿万美元。那是他在自己第一个成功的领域――互联网行业所获得的。<br><br>

基于创新土壤的事业成功和财富积累，在埃伦・穆斯克身上的确实现了正向循环，他是如何做到的呢？<br><br>

成功循环<br><br>

2002年，在线支付系统贝宝（PayPal）以15亿美元出售给了电子港湾（eBay），埃伦・穆斯克作为其创始人之一赚得了第一桶金。贝宝的另一位联合创始人彼得・蒂尔（Peter Thiel）则成了Facebook第一个重要的天使投资人，也是福布斯亿万富豪榜中的一员。和蒂尔一样，穆斯克都着眼于宏大的构想，那些令不敢冒险的人望而却步的东西在他那里从来不是问题。<br><br>

至于此次出售的时机，则是见仁见智。称赞的人认为，埃伦・穆斯克和他伙伴认识到，在科技股泡沫破灭的背景中，他们无法依靠更多的外部融资来发展这家潜力无穷的公司，因此，出售给电商巨头补上产业版图的重要一块，同时实现自己的财务自由，于人于己都是双赢。而那些习惯讽刺的人则说，哦，这只不过又是一群撑不下去的异想天开者遇到一家乱花钱的公司的故事。<br><br>

如今回头来看，贝宝（PayPal）已经是全球电商行业和互联网金融领域最成功的案例，被诸如支付宝等跟随式创新者所学习，也成为电子港湾（eBay）公司最核心资产，其能够继续与亚马逊抗衡，不能不归功于这次收购。<br><br>

而埃伦・穆斯克和彼得・蒂尔，则是利用此次变现后的财富，成为过往10年最成功的创业家和天使投资人群体中的佼佼者。埃伦・穆斯克就将出售获得的1亿8千万美元主要投向了前文所述的三个公司：1亿美元成立SpaceX公司，2000万成立了Solar City，另外6000万陆续投给了Tesla。<br><br>

他似乎是个天生的生意人，从小就懂得如何利用自己的条件和机会去换得现金。<br><br>

出生在南非的埃伦・穆斯克，父亲是一名当地工程师，母亲是加拿大人，从事营养师和模特工作。在他们看来，穆斯克从小就与其他的孩子不一样。“当别的孩子望着月亮，感叹它与地球有多远时，艾隆会说，实际上它与地球的平均距离为38万4400公里。”母亲梅・穆斯克告诉媒体。<br><br>

10岁那年，埃伦・穆斯克拥有了自己的第一台电脑，并且学会了软件编程。两年后，他成功设计出一个名叫“Blastar”的游戏，并为这款商业软件开出了500美元的价格。<br><br>

这个被称为“天才”的孩子，在17岁去了加拿大，而他的最终梦想地则是美国，埃伦・穆斯克说：“那是一个把不可能的事情变成可能的地方。”1992年，他靠奖学金进入了宾夕法尼亚大学，攻读物理学和经济学，然后在获得上述两个专业的学士学位之后，进入斯坦福大学就读应用物理学及材料科学的研究生课程（但只做了两天的学生就退学创业了）。并从此留在了这个创新的沃土，开始把一系列不可能变成可能。<br><br>

每个人大学毕业之时，往往都要做自己的职业规划，但是没有一个人能像埃伦・穆斯克做得如此出色。他当时的职业理想是要进军三个自认为在未来潜力无限的领域――互联网、清洁能源和空间。这三个理想，在他不满40岁时就已统统实现。<br><br>

自从他在斯坦福当了两天学生之后就退学以来，穆斯克一直是他这一代人当中最杰出的魔法师之一。1995年，埃伦・穆斯克和他的兄弟金伯尔・穆斯克（Kimbal Musk）成立了Zip2。在获取巨额回报后，穆斯克又联合创立了X.com，一个在线金融和邮件支付服务公司。它后来与另一家公司Confinity合并，改名为PayPal。再之后就是2002年那场惊人的收购。<br><br>

下注Tesla<br><br>

在2012年，埃伦・穆斯克显然做到了一个更大的贝宝（PayPal）式成功――特斯拉汽车。这家2003年才在美国硅谷成立的公司，从那时开始引起全球IT和资本行业关注。目前是唯一一家在美国上市的纯电动汽车独立制造商。这也是1956年福特汽车IPO以来第一家上市的美国汽车制造商。<br><br>

2012年2月，埃伦・穆斯克将自己生活与工作的两个世界――好莱坞和硅谷――汇聚到了一起。在特斯拉公司的霍桑设计仓库里主持新款特斯拉SUV的发布派对，并引发轰动。出席者包括从时尚人士到风险投资者，从电影《美国队长》（Captain America）的明星演员克里斯・埃文斯（Chris Evans）到加州州长杰瑞・布朗（Jerry Brown）等名流政要，宾客们吃着龙虾，喝着凯歌香槟，大声要求与穆斯克分享片刻时光。<br><br>

身高1.86米，肩宽腿长的穆斯克，身穿深蓝色丝绒运动夹克及深色牛仔裤的站上舞台，一下子成为了聚光灯的中心。在《福布斯》对这场盛宴的描述中，他以一个有关页岩油气开采的水力压裂技术笑话开始了自己的演讲：“世界迫切需要可持续性的交通工具。如果我们本世纪不解决这个问题的话，那么我们都要被‘水力压裂’了！”――依旧是典型极客式的幽默，不管台下能够听懂的人有几个。<br><br>

2013年，特斯拉在北美国际车展亮相。最寒碜的一个展台，不足60平米，装潢简单，仅展出3款汽车，展台上却站满了人，不时有奔驰、宝马这些公司的设计师在这里驻步。但Tesla产品规划负责人Ted merendino告诉媒体：“我们不只限于和其它电动汽车以及替代能源汽车竞争，也包括直接和汽油汽车竞争。 我们自认为可以与奔驰等大牌公司一决高下。”<br><br>

历史刚刚10年的Tesla已经成为代表着硅谷科技的新兴汽车公司的典范。它的产品很“炫”，把很多合成材料第一用在了汽车上。就像当年的iPhone手机一样，深受硅谷青年才俊和好莱坞明星的追捧，比如谷歌创办人拉里・佩奇（Larry Page）和谢尔盖・布林（Sergey Brin），ebay的杰夫・斯科尔（Jeff Skoll）等。当然这些追捧的人，多数也是埃伦・穆斯克的好友与圈内人。<br><br>

特斯拉几乎是埃伦・穆斯克最完美的产品，因为它天然的将互联网、清洁能源和交通工具这三个他本人最感兴趣创新的领域结合，并且他既有的资源让他具有把科技变为现实的整合能力。<br><br>

如果把一辆电动车看作是一部手机，特斯拉正在建设管理自己的电信运营系统――“超级充电网络”（Supercharger）。最初建好的六个充电站用户在加州畅通无阻。充电网络的电力来自SolarCity所提供的车载太阳能系统，使得这套系统只要在安装之后的能源成本几乎为零。这个充电系统功率可达到120千瓦，并且在半个小时的充电之后就让车辆可以继续以60迈的时速开3个小时。<br><br>

而外界观察到的是，埃伦o穆斯克在今年越来越多的探讨起盈利、销售乃至汽车金融。这是一个信号：公司正在成为一家真正的汽车公司，一家具有创新力的实体商业组织。<br><br>

在他最新与一位专栏作家的讨论中，他承认：“特斯拉正在变成一家真正的汽车公司。我想这是我们实现上市后首次季度盈利的一个迹象，而且我充满了希望――未来我们将能够使之成为常态。我的确认为我们正处在一个转折点上。我们现在的目标产量是每年2万辆。我曾许诺，到今年年底时实现25%的毛利，我们目前的进展相当不错。”<br><br>

埃伦・穆斯克觉得，特斯拉身上无疑有着令人兴奋的东西，但他也承认，自己现在要做许多琐事，否则生意就无法运作。“现在我实际上主要关注服务和重返这种服务体验，目前我认为做得还不错，但我们想使它变得”非常棒“。我们想让它成为业务中最好的一部分。久而久之，我的关注点已经从我的固有特长――工程领域--转移到了供应链、生产和现在的服务，以确保客户会有一个很棒的体验。这不是我的自然偏好，但却是需要做的事。”<br><br>

	<b><a name="T7">Zipping Forward: Musk Starts His First Company</a> </b><br>
	<hr>
	
It was 1995. Musk was getting ready to begin his doctorate at Stanford University, but it was not the academic world that was exciting him. Instead, it was the Internet craze that he found himself surrounded by in Silicon Valley. “I could either watch it happen, or be part of it,” he says. <br><br>

 With that, Musk decided to drop out of school and try to get in on the action. He quickly found himself at a standstill, however, having little money to his name. The solution, he figured, was to create a company of his own, and he had just the idea. <br><br>

 Musk founded a company called Zip2. It was a software company that helped news organizations publish their information online. By the time Musk sold it to Compaq, he could count the New York Times and Knight-Ridder as two of his many customers. Compaq bought Zip2 for $307 million in cash and $34 million in additional stock options.<br><br> 

 Instead of entering early retirement with his newfound wealth, Musk decided to invest his profits into his next venture, X.com. The site began by offering a number of banking services to customers online, but Musk quickly discovered that its most popular feature was the ability to send money by email. One year later, Musk bought a company called Confinity, which had developed the ability to send money between Palm Pilots. Musk wanted to use that technology for himself. <br><br>

 In 2001, X.com legally changed its name to PayPal and bought the rights to the domain name. Here, Musk focused solely on improving the ability to securely email money. It was slowly becoming a popular online feature of many websites, including eBay. eBay members found it to be a convenient way to pay for their purchases. It was becoming so popular, in fact, that just months after PayPal went public, it was bought out by eBay for $1.5 billion in stock. <br><br>

 Again, Musk could have sat back and enjoyed his earnings, but sitting back was something Musk did not know how to do. In 2002, Musk started up his third company, but this time he was setting his sights on new heights, literally. With little experience in the field, Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX). He is currently both its CEO and CTO, and is overseeing the company’s efforts to manufacture low cost space launch vehicles. He wants governments, universities and businesses alike to use his company to get satellites cheaply into space. In the long term, Musk wants his company to help colonize outer space.<br><br>

 Musk is also taking a role in the fight against global warming. He is the Chairman of both Tesla Motors, which is trying to bring low-cost electric cars to the market, and SolarCity, a company that focuses on photovoltaics. <br><br>

 Many observers see Musk as being all over the map, moving from online electronic payments to putting satellites into space. But Musk sees little difference between the two ventures; both are about starting up a successful business and turning a dream into reality.

	<b><a name="T8">From PayPal To Planetary Success: How Musk Is Changing The World One Company At A Time</a> </b><br>
	<hr>
	
“If you have millions of dollars it changes your lifestyle, and anyone who says differently is talking bullshit,” says Musk. “I don’t need to work, from a standard of living point of view, but I do, you know. I work every day and on weekends and I haven’t taken a vacation for years.”<br><br> 

Musk may not have taken a vacation for years, but that does not mean he is not having the time of his life. With two successful Internet companies under his belt, and a space exploration company that is promising big things, Musk has proven that his entrepreneurial success is more than the result of just luck. How did this military draft dodger and Stanford University dropout go on to become a millionaire businessman? <br><br>

 Efficiency: Musk hates waste, but more than that, he hates the fact that people have been wasting for years. In the decades since the first man landed on the moon, Musk says little has changed in terms of the high cost of space exploration. And so, by making his operations as lean as possible and reducing any bureaucratic red tape, Musk is challenging that history. <br><br>

 Failure: Musk knew the odds were against him when he began, both with his Internet companies and with Space X. But if Musk was going to fail, he was at least going to commit to failing in a way that nobody else had before. That is why he took the risks he needed to succeed, because he was not afraid of failing. After all, either way, Musk would be achieving something new. <br><br>

 Mission: In starting all three of his companies, Musk was driven by a strong mission, but it was one that was larger than himself. He did not just want to grow a business and make millions of dollars. Musk wanted to change the world, and it was that determination that kept him going. “This is the chance to fulfill a dream,” he says.<br><br>

 Innovation: To those outsiders of the space industry, Musk’s changes might seem insignificant. But he is indeed changing the way the industry is run. From design improvements to technological innovations, Musk is challenging the industry to think outside the box. <br><br>

 Talent: Musk is not only a fan of low numbers when it comes to cost. He does not like to have a large number of staff working for him either. Instead, Musk focuses on keeping a small family of the best and the brightest in his company, and ensuring that they have the resources and the freedom they need to do their jobs. <br><br>

 Musk calls himself “nauseatingly pro-American. It is where great things are possible.” As a South African immigrant, Musk proved that the U.S. has opportunities available for anyone who is ready and willing to seize them. After having conquered the world of online business, Musk set his sights on the skies, and he is determined to play a role in expanding life to new places. “As life’s agents,” he says, “it’s on our shoulders.” <br><br>

	<b><a name="T9">The Wired Entrepreneur: The Early Years of Elon Musk</a> </b><br>
	<hr>
	
“I didn’t really expect to make any money,” he says of his first venture. “If I could make enough to cover the rent and buy some food that would be fine. As it turns out, it turned out to be quite valuable in the end.” <br><br>

He might have dropped out of Stanford University after just two days, but Elon Musk was no slouch when it came to learning. He just wanted to do things his own way. Indeed, Musk moved all the way from his hometown in South Africa to pursue his ideas on cutting edge technology in North America. The first company he founded, Zip2, would be sold to Compaq for $307 million in cash. His second company, PayPal, was not only later sold to eBay for $1.5 billion, but it changed the way the world does business online. Now, Musk is turning his attention to the skies, producing space launch vehicles with his new company SpaceX. This is one entrepreneur who puts no limits on his dreams. <br><br>

 Those dreams began on June 28, 1971 in South Africa. Born to a South African engineer father and a Canadian dietician mother, Musk’s father had a strong impact on the young boy’s life. He inspired Musk’s love of technology. When Musk was just ten years old, he bought himself his first computer. Not knowing anything about computers to begin with, Musk taught himself how to program. Just two years later, he had created a space game called Blaster, and was selling it commercially. <br><br>

 When Musk was 17 years old, he graduated from Pretoria Boys High and decided to leave home against his parents’ wishes. He did not want to take part in the South African military’s compulsory service. “I don’t have an issue with serving in the military per se,” says Musk, “but serving in the South African army suppressing black people just didn’t seem like a really good way to spend time.” <br><br>

Musk decided to make North America his next home. “I think South Africa is a great country,” he says. However, “if you wanted to be close to the cutting edge, particularly in technology, you came to North America.” Musk first made his way to Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario. Even with working part-time jobs, Musk found he was barely making ends meet, living on just $1 a day. His fate would soon change, however, when he was awarded a prestigious scholarship to the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business. “Tuition costs are outrageous,” he recalls. “Fortunately, they gave me a scholarship…so I only had to cover living expenses, books, etc., by working.”<br><br> 

Musk graduated from Wharton with a bachelor’s degree in economics. He decided to stay in Pennsylvania for another year to complete a second bachelor’s degree in physics. At that point, Musk was not quite sure what he wanted to do with his life, but he knew there were three “important problems” that he wanted to get into: “One was the Internet, one was clean energy and one was space.” <br><br>

In 1995, Musk was accepted into a high energy physics graduate program at Stanford University. After just two days, he decided it was not for him and dropped out. He had an idea for a company and he figured a graduate degree would not get him any closer to achieving his goals. <br><br>

	<b><a name="T10">Lesson #1: Keep Your Operations Lean And Clean</a> </b><br>
	<hr>
	
In 2001, Musk had another one of his many dreams: he wanted to launch a “Mars Oasis” project, landing a miniature greenhouse on Mars. He wanted to see if he could grow food on the planet, which would help pave the way for his long term goal of populating outer space. But when Musk began looking into the project, he immediately ran into a major problem. <br><br>

 Musk discovered that the launch costs alone would be so high that they would dwarf even the project’s development. “We could figure out ways with small aerospace companies to do a low-cost spacecraft and lander,” he says. “But we could not find a way to do a low-cost launcher, unless we went to the Russians.” Although he is not against turning to others for help per se, Musk thought that the risks of dealing with the Russians would be too high. He did not want to go through all the complications. <br><br>

 With that, Musk decided to create a feasibility study group. Before he was going to move forward, Musk wanted to know if it was even possible to create a low-cost space launch vehicle in America, one that was not only cheap but still equally as reliable. Musk, along with a number of rocket experts studied the issue and came to one conclusion: “The answer was we thought it could be done,” says Musk, and he was the one that was going to do it. <br><br>

“There is nothing inherently expensive about rockets,” says Musk. “It's just that those who have built and operated them in the past have done so with horrendously poor efficiency.” <br><br>

And so, Musk created Falcon One. “Falcon One is going to be the lowest cost per flight to orbit of any production rocket,” says Musk. At jut $15 million per lift off, Musk has achieved his goal. “Which means we’re cheaper than the Chinese, cheaper than [the] Russians or anywhere else C and we’re doing it in the United States with American labour costs.”<br><br>

How has Musk been able to achieve his goal? “I think the reason it’s cheaper is, first of all, we are a private entity and we have a very lean system in here,” he says. “What we have been able to do here at SpaceX is to cherry-pick, you know, the top one or two percent and give them, you know, capital to execute well and a clear mission, which is low cost, reliable access to space, and no other constraints.” To that end, Musk employs just 140 people and refuses to bog them down with bureaucracy. <br><br>

 When Musk first started in the space industry, rockets were designed with quality and performance in mind and little concern with cost. Launching satellites would cost almost three times as much as the actual satellite that was being launched. Today, Musk is happy about how far his company has come, but says that is not what should have people talking. Instead, they should be wondering why everyone is not doing things like him. And, whether it’s building rockets or launching online payment systems, Musk says the number one priority should be on keeping the business a lean, mean, money-making machine. <br><br>

	<b><a name="T11">Lesson #2: Commit To Failing In A New Way</a> </b><br>
	<hr>
	

“Well, I have tried to learn as much as possible from prior attempts,” says Musk. “If nothing else, we are committed to failing in a new way.” <br><br>

In launching his space exploration company, Musk knew he was getting himself into dangerous territory. He had little to no experience in the field, and he knew that many if not most of those who had come before him had failed. Starting a business in this industry, Musk knew, he was setting himself up for failure. Indeed, the odds were against him. But Musk was willing to take that chance. And he decided that if he was going to fail, he was going to fail differently than anyone else ever had. <br><br>

“There’s a graveyard of prior attempts, a big graveyard,” he says. “There’s probably some freshly dug graves just waiting to be filled. Our aspiration is to avoid that destination.” Musk analyzed the reasons for which previous companies in his line of work had failed. He narrowed it down to three: the lack of critical mass of the appropriate technical skill; insufficient capital to complete the project, especially in the face of unexpected obstacles; and, relying on a series of technological breakthroughs that never happened. <br><br>

“I think we’ve got the risks pretty well characterized,” says Musk. “I think we are at least avoiding the mistakes that have been made in the past.” Still, he admits, that upbeat attitude might change in a few months time. “I think the rocket business is quite cyclic. There are a great many peaks and troughs.” <br><br>

To that end, Musk says this third business is much more of a challenge than either of his first two, Zip2 and PayPal, although he uses them as an analogy to compare. “Imagine creating a huge software program that can only be tested in little pieces on a computer that is slightly different from what it is supposed to run on,” he says. “However, when you do run it as a whole on the actual computer for the first time, it must run almost flawlessly without a single significant bug. When is the last time you saw a software program do that?” <br><br>

Despite the troughs, however, Musk believes in the promise of the industry, and thinks the risk of failing is one worth taking. “When thinking about starting a business, I think it’s actually better to start in a trough and come to market in a peak, than the other way around,” he says. “Frankly, if anything does, and it’s almost cliché, space has a long-term future.”<br><br>

And, through it all, Musk is willing to continue working towards his dream because he is having fun in the process. That is why he is putting everything he has into it. “I want to be able to make sure that we have enough capital to survive at least three consecutive failures,” he says. “If you want to make a small fortune in the launch vehicle business, start with a large one.”<br><br>

	<b><a name="T12">Lesson #3: Make Your Mission Your Holy Grail</a> </b><br>
	<hr>
	
“The long term ultimate objective C the holy grail C is we would like to help make life multi-planetary,” says Musk.<br><br> 

 Musk first dreamed up his third company after a night of space talk with a friend. They realized that while the world has come to expect improvements in almost every technological sector, the space industry seems to be exempt from that expectation. Indeed, Musk says, there has been relatively little progress at all since the first man landed on the moon. <br><br>

“We got to the moon, but have never done anything better since,” he says. “I'm disappointed that we have not made more progress since Apollo. I don't even see a plan that says we're going to do better than Apollo to exceed that goal.” <br><br>

Musk wants to be the one to exceed that goal. But the new goal Musk is setting for himself is not just to create a successful company this time around. Musk wants to be a part of something that is bigger than himself, something that will have a lasting impact on the world. <br><br>

“I like to be involved in things that change the world,” he says. “The Internet did, and space will probably be more responsible for changing the world than anything else. If humanity can expand beyond the Earth, obviously that's where the future is.” <br><br>

Musk wants his company to lead the way to that future. “If we can be one of the companies that makes it possible for humans to become a multi-planetary species, that would be the Holy Grail,” he says. “It sounds a bit crazy but it's going to happen, and only if people build the means to do so. We're making progress toward a greater philosophical goal while building a sound business.” <br><br>

Whether it was capitalizing on the early days of the Internet and building a platform to allow for easy online money transactions, or building rockets that will eventually help colonize space, Musk has always had a bigger picture on his agenda. It is precisely that vision that many observers believe will allow Musk to succeed where others before him have failed. To those who do not believe in him, Musk says this: “When Henry Ford made cheap, reliable cars people said, 'Nah, what's wrong with a horse?' That was a huge bet he made, and it worked.” <br><br>

A number of entrepreneurs also wanting to fulfill their space dreams have come before Musk, most notably Mark Shuttleworth, who paid $20 million and spent six months in Russia training to be able to become the second self-funded tourist in space. But Musk’s dreams are loftier than that. <br><br>

“It doesn’t do a great deal to advance the goal of humanity,” says Musk. “I would pay $20 million not to spend six months in Russia. And besides this, my interest is how do we enable many other people to go to space, not necessarily me, personally.” <br><br>
Musk’s goal has never been to go into space. Eventually, that is something he would love to do. But for right now, he is happy focusing his efforts on a larger dream, the dream of building a company that will change the world. <br><br>

“If we can build something that is capable of taking people and equipment to Mars,” says Musk, “such that it can service a transportation infrastructure for humanity becoming a multi- planet species - which I think is a very, very important objective - then I would consider the mission of SpaceX successful, at that point.” <br><br>

	<b><a name="T13">Lesson #4: Use Innovation To Break Through Your Limitations</a> </b><br>
	<hr>
	
“We are used to things improving every year; we are used to having a better cell phone next year than this year; a better lap top,” says Musk. “We are even used to some basic things, like we expect more from your car in next year’s model than last year’s model. But this is not the case in space; reliability and cost - those are the fundamental parameters of transportation - have not improved.”<br><br>

Space exploration is nothing new. Indeed, for decades, entrepreneurs and scientists alike have been in a race to explore and populate undiscovered areas of outer space. So why is Musk’s company, SpaceX, showing so much promise? Why do many experts believe that if anyone can have a serious impact, Musk can? The answer to those questions is the same reason behind the success of Musk’s first two companies, Zip2 and PayPal. Musk used innovation to break through his C and the rest of the world’s C limitations. <br><br>

“Starting and growing a business is as much about the innovation, drive and determination of the people who do it as it is about the product they sell,” says Musk. That is why Musk sees little difference between the three different companies he founded; all were driven by Musk’s determination and drive to succeed and change the world, and all were based on being innovative. All three of Musk’s businesses did things that either no one else was doing yet, or doing them in a way that no body else had thought of yet. And that is why he was able to succeed where others fell by the wayside. <br><br>

 Before beginning to build his own rockets, Musk took a look at all of the ones that his predecessors and competitors had built before him. He looked at the technology and he looked at the design. He took what he thought was not working and he set out to fix it. As a result of the changes Musk made, he has been able to build rockets that are lower cost and higher performance. <br><br>

 The list of innovations and improvements Musk and his team made to their SpaceX rockets is long. They changed the engine, giving it the lowest possible cost choice of architecture, covering it with fireproof blankets, and improving its pump and injector. “So even if a fire develops, it can't really attack the particularly vulnerable locations like the pneumatic system or the avionics or the engine bay,” says Musk. “We want to be in the situation that even if a fire develops, the rocket just keeps going.”<br><br>

They changed the rocket’s structure, giving it an inexpensive aluminum tank, and enabling it to stand un-pressurized on a launch pad in even extreme winds. They updated its avionics with the latest technology. They made a rocket that would be completely assembled in the SpaceX factory so that no army of workers would later be required at the launch site. <br><br>

 For Musk, however, one of the greatest innovations at SpaceX is its “ability to make almost any part of the rocket in house.” This, he says, gives it “a great deal of bargaining power with suppliers. We are never locked in to anyone.” <br><br>

And so, just like he did with his two Internet companies, Musk is making sure that he has total control over his operations and can improve things where he sees fit. Those innovations are giving SpaceX its lifeline, and Musk a third chance at success.

	<b><a name="T14">Lesson #5: Tap Into Today’s Top Talent</a> </b><br>
	<hr>
	
“I think it is a mistake to hire huge numbers of people to get a complicated job done,” says Musk. “Numbers will never compensate for talent in getting the right answer (two people who don't know something are no better than one), will tend to slow down progress, and will make the task incredibly expensive.” <br><br>

Musk’s third company, Space X, is located in Southern California, right in the midst of one of the world’s most concentrated regions of defense and aerospace companies. But before he even began thinking about moving to the area, Musk decided to see what resources he would have available to him. <br><br>

 First, Musk began by cold-calling some of the top experts in the field. He wanted to get their opinions not only on his idea for a company and the challenges that lay therein, but also to see who was available to join his team. <br><br>

“My approach is simply to seek out very talented people, ensure that the environment at SpaceX is as motivating and enjoyable as possible and establish clear and measurable objectives,” says Musk.<br><br>

 He began luring the likes of Tom Mueller to his team. Mueller, who currently serves as the company’s vice president of propulsion, was snatched up by Musk from his previous job as head of liquid rocket propulsion development at TRW Space & Electronics. Musk wanted to get on his team the top talent, people who had experience building rockets before. <br><br>

“Rocket engineering is not like ditch digging,” he says. “With ditch digging you can get 100 people and dig a ditch, and you will dig it a hundred times as faster if you get 100 people versus one. With rockets, you have to solve the problem of a particular level of difficulty; one person who can solve the problem is worth an infinite number of people who can’t.”<br><br>

But it was not just about luring the brightest minds to his company. Musk wanted to make sure he was getting the people with the most appropriate qualifications and skills. For instance, many who came before him made the mistake of bringing on board top aerospace senior managers. While undoubtedly qualified, Musk thought they were unable to do some of the hard core engineering tasks that he wanted. “I think that is a mistake and results in cloudy judgment on important technical issues,” he says. “They can't tell if something is really good or not, so they just do what everyone else does, assuming it to be the safe bet.” <br><br>

And, no matter how qualified any of his team members were, Musk also made sure that no stone was left unturned, no chance left up to human error. “We're adding a triple sign-off for all work done on the launch pad, on flight components, and flight critical GSE,” he says. “You have a technician, a responsible engineer, and then quality assurance will sign the final, record all information, and take photographs of all the work that was done, and then make sure that all information is put into our quality assurance database, which is reviewed prior to launch.” <br><br>

Musk understands that the major driving force behind any company is its people. By bringing on the best, and giving them the freedom and motivation to accomplish their responsibilities, Musk made sure he had people working alongside him who were as talented and driven as he. <br><br>

“Although I am new in the business, my team is not,” says Musk. “I would say that, person for person, there has never been a better rocket company in existence, in history. I don’t think there has ever been a group this talented in one place, in one company, developing a rocket C ever.”<br><br>

Elon’s interest in physics was inspired by Richard Feynman’s lectures and books.<br><br>

[Physics is] a good framework for thinking. … Boil  things down to their fundamental truths and reason up from there.<br><br>

Analogy, which most people use in their daily life, just copy with slightly variation. <br><br>

But when you want to do something new, you have to apply the physics approach. Physics is really figuring out how to discover new things that are counter intuitive (abnormal), like Quantum Mechanics. That's real innovation.  <br><br>

A. Carnegie：对差异的敏感！ <br><br>

原文：<br><br>

Well, I do think there’s a good framework for thinking. It is physics. You know, the sort of first principles reasoning. <br><br>

Generally I think there are ― what I mean by that is, boil things down to their fundamental truths and reason up from there, as opposed to reasoning by analogy. Through most of our life, we get through life by reasoning by analogy, which essentially means copying what other people do with slight variations. And you have to do that. Otherwise, mentally, you wouldn’t be able to get through the day.<br><br>

But when you want to do something new, you have to apply the physics approach. Physics is really figuring out how to discover new things that are counterintuitive, like quantum mechanics. It’s really counterintuitive. So I think that’s an important thing to do.<br><br>

And then also to really pay attention to negative feedback, and solicit it, particularly from friends. This may sound like simple advice, but hardly anyone does that, and it’s incredibly helpful.<br><br>

Really pay attention to negative feedback and solicit it, particularly from friends. … Hardly anyone does that, and it's incredibly helpful.”

Elon Musk is the chief designer for SpaceX, overseeing development of rockets and spacecraft for missions to Earth orbit and ultimately to other planets. In 2008, SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft won the NASA contract to provide a commercial replacement for the cargo transport function of the space shuttle. In 2012, SpaceX became the first commercial company to dock with the International Space Station and return cargo to Earth with the Dragon.<br><br>

At Tesla, Musk has overseen product development and design from the beginning, including the all-electric Tesla Roadster, Model S and Model X, and overseeing the rollout of Supercharger stations to keep the cars juiced up. (Some of the charging stations use solar energy systems from SolarCity, of which Musk is the non-executive chair.) Transitioning to a sustainable energy economy, in which electric vehicles play a pivotal role, has been one of his central interests for almost two decades. He co-founded PayPal and served as the company's chair and CEO.<br><br>

"I'm glad that Tesla is pushing the envelope. No one else was going to do it. Dream big or go home."<br><br>
Margarita, commenting on nytimes.com<br><br>


Today at a big tech conference, South by Southwest, Elon Musk told thousands of listeners that he has great admiration for Benjamin Franklin, Winston Churchill, Sergey Brin, Larry Page, Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos.<br><br>

"I've been inspired by a lot of historical figures," Musk said. "One of my favorite guys is Ben Franklin. He just thought about what are the problems that need to get solved and worked on those. He seemed like a good guy all around. I like historical figures in science and literature."<br><br>

Next, Musk was asked for the best advice he's ever received.<br><br>

Musk says it didn't come from a person. It came from studying physics.<br><br>

"The physics training is very good training," he said. "It's a good framework for reasoning. You break things down to the most fundamental truths, and break them down to try and figure out what reality is. You have got have a framework for getting there. Quantum Mechanics is incredibly counter-intuitive, but it's true. It's a lot of advice, and it's the right framework."<br><br>

Overall, Musk is a fan of critical thinking.<br><br>

"Just in general, critical thinking is good," he said. "Does the logic connect? What are the range of probably outcomes? You want to figure out what those probabilities are and ideally be the House. It's fine to gamble, as long as you're the House. Also, listen to critical feedback, particularly from friends. Generally they will be thinking it but they won't tell you."<br><br>


As it happens, he appears to be out to revolutionize several Earth-based industries (clean tech, automotive, air travel, and the proverbial more) ― whilst simultaneously ensuring that the human race becomes multiplanetary (in effect, purchasing an “insurance policy for the human race.”)<br><br>

Elon is nothing less than the Henry Ford (slash Howard Hughes) of the 21st century, shrinking time and distance with the invention & mass-production of the first reusable rocket, a revolutionary innovation that will fundamentally change humanity’s relationship to the stars.<br><br>

And yet, it’s clear Elon is thinking bigger than Ford ever did, not only of introducing new products and creating whole new industries, but doing so for reasons more elevated than the desire to amass wealth. . .<br><br>


“I always had an existential crisis, trying to figure out ‘what does it all mean?’ I came to the conclusion that if we can advance the knowledge of the world, if we can expand the scope and scale of consciousness, then, we’re better able to ask the right questions and become more enlightened. That’s the only way to move forward.”<br><br>

Elon has said that he wants his rocket company SpaceX to become “like the shipping company that brought people to America, or the Union Pacific Railroad” in it’s relationship to human space travel, and certainly he’ll make a lot of money in the process, but there’s a strong metaphysical motivation here: to ensure that the light of human consciousness cannot be extinguished by an errant asteroid or the rapid break-down in the planetary food chain threatened by unprecedented global CO2 levels.<br><br>

I can’t think of anyone I’d rather have working on that problem. From the very beginning, Musk proved his ability to presciently scan the future and invent it just as it became possible: he was responsible for the merger deal and the viral marketing campaign that resulted in the first popular payment gateway C PayPal C from his position in the early e-commerce and financial services company X.com.<br><br>

It was PayPal’s sale in 2002 that netted Elon his first fortune, roughly $250 million USD, of which he promptly sunk $100 million into his next two venture, Space Exploration Inc and Tesla Motors.<br><br>

Musk went on to summarily prove his ability to produce evolutionary innovations in existing industries, with the introduction of the first mass-produced fully electric car of the modern era (or rather, the first mass-produced electric car that wasn’t mysteriously recalled and junked for no apparent reason), as well as a complementary company, SolarCity, that is the largest provider of solar-leasing arrangements in the U.S.<br><br>

Musk plans to use his electric cars from Tesla to help with energy storage of all the solar power now being passively collected by SolarCity arrays.<br><br>

Elon is now working 100 hours a week on both companies (while chairing SolarCity on the side) in an effort to solve the C02 problem and make humanity multi-planetary in the bargain.<br><br>

Elon is focused on taking us to Mars, not the Moon, which makes a counter-intuitive kind of sense ― Mars is more hospitable to human life than the moon, despite being farther; the planet is more fully stocked with useful-to-Earthian resources.<br><br>

Along the way, he’s fathered five kids, married (& divorced) two gorgeous women, produced a couple of movies (including the excellent 2005 comedy-drama Thank You For Smoking), appeared in one movie (the otherwise lackluster Iron Man 2) and, oh yes, he has pledged his fortune to charity alongside Warren Buffet and Bill Gates.<br><br>

And, he’s a snappy dresser who prefers light-pattern checks <br><br>

CRITICISMS OF MUSK<br><br>

Some have accused Musk of ‘failing forward’ ― that is, continually moving to the next big idea, when his current big idea has not yet run its full course. Tesla Motors had trouble filling orders of the original Roadster, and has faced similar production delays with the Model S ― surely a sympathetic problem for anyone else who’s ever designed a gotta-have-it product (Steve Jobs, may he rest in peace, is quietly smiling in his grave.)<br><br>

An Esquire interview quotes a Jim Cantrell as saying, “Right now, he’s producing rockets at an industry average, and yet his flight manifest is much higher than industry average. It’s exactly like Tesla. He has a rocket that works. But before he even finishes with that, he’s building the next one.”<br><br>

This criticism might be true. Any casual observer can see that Musk is “on to the next one” (warning: link contains hip-hop music) much more rapidly than his contemporaries, or more rapidly than anyone might deem wise. The Peter Jackson adage, “One job at a time. Every job a success,” seems not to apply to Musk, who seems constitutionally unable to do just one thing at a time.<br><br>

But if this is what failing forward looks like, then I say, fail on, Elon ― in this sort of failure you are still succeeding, because the copycats who will inevitably follow in your wake-trail can do no worse than successfully execute your vision at higher and higher levels of excellence (even if they can’t quite bring themselves to dare as greatly than you.)<br><br>

Elon’s genius, then, is in his demonstration to all the rest of us of just what can be accomplished in 100-hour work weeks, when one makes full use of one’s natural-born talents ― in Elon’s case, a rare autodidact’s ability to absorb information (the man literally taught himself rocket science from textbooks).<br><br>

Not all of us have this crazy learning skill, but we have other skills. Are we taking full advantage of our natural assets? Are we devoting as much time as he is to developing them, and to putting them in service to as big a slice of humanity as we can get our arms around?<br><br>

Elon challenges us to do just this. As such, he is the quintessential Fierce Gentleman.<br><br>


We need to figure out how to have the things we love… and not destroy the world.<br><br>






Elon Musk: The Role of Analogy and Reasoning From First Principles in Disruptive Entrepreneurship<br><br>
 

In terms of getting an insight into “Tony Stark’s” head, the last 5-ish minutes of Kevin’s Rose’s Foundation interview of Elon Musk is a gem:<br><br>


I think its important to reason from first principles rather than by analogy…The normal way we conduct our lives is we reason by analogy…<br><br>

We are doing this because it’s like something else that was done..or it is like what other people are doing…slight iterations on a theme…<br><br>

“First principles” is a physics way of looking at the world…what that really means is that you boil things down to the most fundamental truths…and then reason up from there…that takes a lot more mental energy…<br><br>

Someone could Cand people do ― say battery packs are really expensive and that’s just the way they will always be because that’s the way they have been in the past…<br><br>

They would say it’s going to cost, historically it cost $600 KW/hour.  It’s not going to be much better that in the future…<br><br>

So first principles..we say what are the material constituents of the batteries.  What is the spot market value of the material constituents?  It has carbon, nickel, aluminum, and some polymers for separation, and a steel can..break that down on a material basis, if we bought that on a London Metal Exchange, what would each of these things cost.  oh geez…It’s $80 KW/hour.  Clearly, you need to think of clever ways to take those materials and combine them into the shape of a battery cell, and you can have batteries that are much cheaper than anyone realizes.<br><br>

The contrast that Elon makes is between reasoning by analogy and reasoning from first principles, i.e., finding fundamental principles and reasoning up from there. The assertion he makes is that the method of being truly creative is reasoning from first principles.<br><br>

This assertion is surprising in a sense.  We tend to intuitively think that reasoning by analogy is superior.  In fact, it is important in some cases, such as when you use an analogy that is distinct ― bringing ideas from completely disparate fields to spark a new way of thinking of your problem.  Think of Da Vinci and Darwin.<br><br>

I think it’s better to think of Musk as criticizing close analogy.  This is dangerous in at least two ways.<br><br>

First, you can become an incremental thinker, chasing and seduced by ideas like:<br><br>
 We are the pinterest of X…<br><br>
 We are the foursquare of Y…<br><br>

This type of thinking is seductive in Tech World, in parts, because it is also very amenable to venture pitches, easy communication, and Tweets.<br><br>

Second, and I think perhaps more dangerous from Elon’s perspective is that analogical thinking squashes creative ideas.  The example he uses above ― the cost of batteries ― is illustrative.  Using reasoning by analogy, conventional wisdom drawn from past electric battery efforts was that cost could not be reduced past a certain point.<br><br>

As explained by Musk, from a first principle perspective, this was not true if you thought of the battery problem in terms of the cost of the components.<br><br>

Another example from Elon’s world is with rockets.  Analogizing to the experience and costs of government space programs hampered almost everyone’s thinking as to the viability of private space ventures.  SpaceX’s efforts, so far, have shattered this conventional wisdom, and manned space exploration is next on its radar.<br><br>

A place where this comes up in personal efforts at entrepreneurship is thinking about the way certain markets are today.  You have a choice:<br><br>

If you see a problem in the relation of a market structure and the results that flow from that structure, you can analogize to past or current status quo thinking, and can be deterred in moving forward, thinking that there is a good reason that past efforts have failed or there is an inevitable reason that the market structure is the way it is.<br><br>

Or, you can examine rigorously from a first principles perspective.  If after exhaustive exploration of the first principles, and the reasoning built on that, you can remain convinced that you are correct about the problem in market structure.  Then the question is do you have the courage to move forward and tackle it to change it and create customer value.<br><br>

Elon Musk, the Rocket Man With a Sweet Ride <br><br>

The winner of the Smithsonian Ingenuity Award for technology hopes to launch a revolution with his spaceship and electric car <br><br>

“Five, four, three...” At T-minus three seconds white flames explode from the 22-story rocket. “Two, one. Liftoff.” The night sky erupts with light and fire and clouds of smoke, as nine engines generating 1,320,000 pounds of thrust push the vehicle skyward at NASA’s storied Cape Canaveral launchpad. The road to orbit is short but marked with a series of technical miracles, and the rocket hits them all: 17,000 miles per hour to break from Earth’s atmosphere. First and second stage separation. Second stage ignition. In minutes it’s over: The capsule carrying 1,000 pounds of cargo is in orbit, racing toward a docking with the International Space Station, itself traveling so fast it circles the Earth 15 times a day, the second such flight of the Falcon 9 and its Dragon capsule since May. “It proves that we didn’t just get lucky the first time around,” says the rocket’s chief designer, Elon Musk. “Next year we expect four to five launches, the year after that eight to ten, and the launch rate will increase by 100 percent every year for the next four to five years.” At that rate Musk, a self-taught engineer and Internet whiz kid, will be launching more rockets than even China or Russia.<br><br>

There are few things more difficult than putting something into orbit. Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, the space shuttle―we think of rockets and we think of the oldest, most staid monoliths: the U.S. government. NASA. Lockheed. Boeing. Space, a frontier so dangerous, so daunting, so complex and impossible, that it belongs not to the realm of lone adventurers and daring entrepreneurs, but to the combined might of the most powerful military industrial complex in the world. Except this rocket wasn’t built or launched by the U.S. government, or even Lockheed or Boeing, but by guys in surfer shorts and T-shirts, overseen by an Internet millionaire. Its flight was historic: the first privately designed, built and launched cargo resupply mission to the ISS. Or, put another way, since the retirement of the space shuttle, a small start-up company’s rocket and space capsule, which cost roughly one-tenth of a space shuttle launch to launch, has become the United States’ sole means of reaching the $100 billion space station. “Our first order of business,” says Musk, sitting in his cubicle in Hawthorne, California, “is to defeat the incumbent, old school rocket companies. Lockheed. Boeing. Russia. China. If this is a chess game, they don’t have much of a chance.”<br><br>

Musk wants to fundamentally alter the way we travel, the energy we consume and our legacy as earthbound human beings. Listening to the self-confident and boyish 41-year-old wearing blue jeans and a black and white checked shirt rocking back and forth in his Aeron chair, he sounds ridiculous: He talks about nuclear fusion and colonizing Mars and airplanes that take off vertically. You want to slap him, put him in his place, or just laugh and dismiss him, which is what the aerospace industry did when he first announced plans to disrupt an industry so technically difficult and capital intensive that it has belonged to the world’s richest governments.<br><br>

But Musk looked skyward and said he could build a rocket that would put cargo and humans into orbit cheaper and more reliably than any nation or corporation had ever done before, and that he could do it faster than any other private company. Today he is CEO and chief designer at Space Exploration Technologies, known as SpaceX, whose Dragon space capsule first docked with the International Space Station in May in a test flight, a feat achieved by only three nations and the European Space Agency―and, for now, the United States’ sole means of reaching the ISS without foreign help. SpaceX has sent five rockets into orbit, has $1.6 billion in contracts from NASA, 45 launches on order and employs 2,000 people designing and building more rocket engines than any other company on earth.<br><br>

When he’s not launching rockets, Musk is disrupting the notoriously obdurate automobile industry (see National Treasure, p. 42). While industry giants like Chevrolet and Nissan and Toyota were dithering with electric-gasoline hybrids, this upstart kid said he would design and manufacture an all-electric car that would travel hundreds of miles on a single charge. The Tesla Roadster hit the streets in 2008 with a range of 200 miles, and the far more functional Model S, starting at $57,000, was introduced in June. It’s the world’s first all-electric car that does everything my old gasoline version does, only better. The high-end model travels 300 miles on a single charge, leaps from zero to 60 in 5.5 seconds, slows from 60 to a dead stop in 105 feet, can seat up to five, has room for mulch bags and golf clubs, handles like a race car and its battery comes with an eight-year, 100,000-mile warranty. If you charged it via solar panels, it would run off the sun. One hundred a week are being produced in a former Toyota factory in Fremont, California, and nearly 13,000 people have put deposits on them.<br><br>

As if the space and cars weren’t enough to tackle, Musk is simultaneously trying to revolutionize the energy industry as well. He is the biggest investor and chairman of the board of Solar City, one of the largest suppliers of solar energy technology and a key piece of his aim to change not just energy consumption, but energy production.<br><br>

Musk’s rocket docking with the space station on only its second flight required a “sequence of miracles that was a phenomenal achievement,” says Michael Lopez-Alegria, a former Navy test pilot, a veteran of four NASA space shuttle missions and president of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation.<br><br>

“Musk said here’s what I’m going to do and he did it,” says Gen. Jack Dailey, director of the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum. “He’s the real thing and that’s pretty clear now.”<br><br>

***<br><br>

Complex pieces of technology are tools, and tools are best thought of as extensions of human hands, which are themselves just extensions of the human mind. And the mind behind Tesla and SpaceX is a self-taught engineer and pioneer of shopping on the Internet. A few steps away from Musk’s cube in a cavernous building where Boeing 747s used to be made are huge extruded aluminum tubes that will soon be rocket bodies, and clean rooms filled with snaking stainless steel that is the heart of rocket motors. This is no Internet dream, no plan, no raw idea, but a place where hundreds of smart, young engineers have been unleashed by Musk, a guy who dropped out of a graduate program in applied physics at Stanford in 1995 to create a company, Zip2, with his brother, Kimbal, which they sold to Compaq Computer for $300 million. His next company, X.com, became PayPal and he was the largest shareholder when it was sold to eBay for $1.5 billion.<br><br>

Musk walked away with some $180 million and could have taken his newfound wealth and played bocce on the deck of a yacht or tried for the next big thing on the Internet. Except that Musk, put simply, is a little bit weird and always has been. What appears brash self-confidence is simply precocious intelligence and a strangely literal mind mixed with a deep urge to change the world. “Most people, when they make a lot of money don’t want to risk it,” he says. “For me it was never about money, but solving problems for the future of humanity.” He does not laugh or crack a smile when he says this. There is no hint of irony.<br><br>

 
As a child growing up in Pretoria, South Africa, his mother thought he might have hearing problems. “We called Elon ‘genius boy,’” says his mother, Maye. “His brain was just ahead of everyone else’s and we thought he was deaf, so we took him to the doctor. But he was just in his own world.” Musk shrugs when I tell him that story. “They took my adenoids out, but it didn’t change anything. It’s just when I’m concentrating on something I tune everything else out.” He was bullied by other kids. He hated going to school. He was obsessed with facts and reading. “If someone said the Moon is, like, a million miles away,” says Maye, “he’d say, ‘No, it’s 238,855 miles from the Earth, depending on when you view it.’ Kids would just go ‘Huh?’ He’s just curious about everything and never stops reading and remembers everything he reads. He’s not in la-la land; he just sees everything as a problem that can be fixed.”<br><br>

Tesla was largely the brainchild of another man, JB Straubel, who created a way to link hundreds of lithium ion batteries―essentially the same ones powering your laptop―together for unprecedented battery life. Musk jumped in and became the primary investor in the company, on which he now spends half his time. “Elon drives this think-bigger mentality,” says Straubel, in a lofty design studio behind SpaceX. “As engineers we tend to want to keep things small, but Elon is always imagining something so large it’s terrifying, and he’s incredibly demanding and hard-driving.”<br><br>

Musk picks up a model of the Falcon 9 Heavy Lift, which will have the largest payload of any rocket anywhere and which he hopes to launch next year. There’s not a part in his spacecraft with which he’s not intimately familiar. To him, the problem with space seemed straightforward: All existing rockets used technology developed by governments for maximum performance without regard to cost. Every rocket is made to order and used for a single flight and then thrown away. “Imagine,” he says, “if you built a new 747 for every flight.”<br><br>

Musk started SpaceX in 2002 and oversaw the development of a vehicle from scratch. He had a basic idea of what he wanted, how it should be done, but he hired veterans from TRW, Boeing and NASA to work out the details. He sacrificed a small amount of performance for cost. He patented nothing because he didn’t want competitors―especially China―to see even hints of his technology. He built and designed his own engines and oversaw all the design and tech decisions.<br><br>

“I’m head engineer and chief designer as well as CEO, so I don’t have to cave to some money guy,” he says. “I encounter CEOs who don’t know the details of their technology and that’s ridiculous to me.” He built a facility on the Texas plains where every piece of equipment SpaceX builds is tested before it’s integrated with the rocket.<br><br>

When his first three attempts at launch failed, he lost millions of dollars; his personal fortune was at risk. But he saw opportunity instead of defeat―every failure just meant more data and more chances to identify the problems and fix them. And fix them he appears to have done. He launched his Falcon 1, a much smaller version than the one that sent up the Dragon in May, on his fourth try with a team of eight in the control room, instead of dozens. Since then he’s five for five with his Falcon 9. “Silicon Valley gave me both capital and a way of running companies that are efficient at innovation,” he tells me. “It’s Darwinian there―you innovate or die.”<br><br>

“The culture that he fostered made it possible,” says Roger Launius, aeronautics curator at the National Air and Space Museum. “He intentionally took a very basic approach and stayed away from technical enhancements that would have cost more and caused delays.”<br><br>

The result: He’s offering to send a 10,000-pound payload into geosynchronous orbit for $60 million, compared with a United Launch Alliance Delta flight cost of $300 million (a space shuttle flight cost upward of $1 billion). If he can get “full and rapid reusability”―if he can figure out how to recover not just the second stage Dragon capsule, but the first stage of his Falcon 9―he’ll have done what no one has ever done before: created a fully reusable rocket for which the fuel costs only $200,000 per flight. “Humanity will always be confined to Earth unless someone invents a reusable rocket,” he says. “That is the pivotal innovation to make life interplanetary, and I think we’re close―check out the designs we’ve put out on Twitter and the website, which we’re going to start testing soon,” he says, getting agitated.<br><br>

***

The difference between Musk and everyone else is that passion and ambition. When Tesla nearly went bankrupt, he fired its CEO, took over the role himself and risked his personal fortune, pouring $75 million into the company. As production delays have eaten into Tesla’s cash, some analysts have doubted the company’s viability. But Musk renegotiated the terms of a government loan, sold shares in the company and seems to have fixed its production delays. “The factory is state of the art,” says Elaine Kwei, an auto industry analyst with Jefferies & Company, “and the delays were little things from other suppliers, like door handles. The car is awesome and demand doesn’t seem to be an issue; if they can sell 13,000 cars next year, they’ll break even. Tesla has the potential to dominate the EV category, similar to the Toyota Prius’ dominance of the hybrid electric segment.”<br><br>

Making a lot of money on an electric car or resupplying the ISS or even launching satellites cheaper than anyone else isn’t his goal. Musk wants a revolution. To change the way the world is powered, to rid it of the internal combustion engine and to create a new age of interplanetary exploration.<br><br>


 
In Musk’s world, we’ve broken our dependence on fossil fuels and imprisonment on Earth itself. “The question,” he says, “isn’t ‘Can you prove that we’re making the planet warmer?’ but ‘Can you prove we’re not?’ And you can’t. Think of that famous experiment about children and gratification. The kid who can delay his gratification for the cupcake for five minutes will be the more successful kid. That’s us, but we’re the unsuccessful kid. We will run out of oil and we’re engaged in this dangerous experiment of pushing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. It’s crazy.” For Musk, the Tesla Model S and the Falcon 9 are simply the first steps toward ending that “experiment.”<br><br>

Although the highest-priced Model S has a range of 300 miles, it still takes nine hours to recharge on a standard 240-volt electrical hookup, making your classic long family drive impractical, and the single largest barrier to widespread electric vehicle use. But in late October, Tesla planned to open in California the first six of a planned network of 100 electrical filling stations around the U.S., dubbed “superchargers,” which pump electricity at 90 kilowatts, adding 250 miles to the highest-priced Model S’s battery (the lowest-cost model doesn’t yet have this capability) in one hour. Where the filling stations can be solar powered, that means zero fossil fuels and zero emissions. Drive in, grab lunch, and in 30 minutes you’re cruising with another 120-odd miles of range. With an electric vehicle that has a reasonable range and rapid filling stations available, the barriers to electric cars fall; as more people get them, the laws of mass production dramatically reduce their price. Bingo; why would anyone have a car that costs 70 bucks to fill up and pollutes the planet?<br><br>

Ditto with rockets. Their design and successful launch is, in fact, rocket science, and sending 10,000 pounds into low-Earth orbit, docking with the ISS and returning to Earth are incredibly difficult, hence Lopez-Alegria’s use of the word “miracle.” Yet it has been done many times before over the past 50 years. “It’s a major accomplishment,” says curator Launius, “but it’s technically insignificant. Elon himself has made a big fact that he’s not pioneering technology but leveraging what is already known.” Again, it comes down to scale. The more rockets he can build and launch, the cheaper they’ll be. These first flights to the ISS are just the means, the U.S. subsidizing the development of low-cost space technology so we can burst out into the cosmos.<br><br>

“If our objective is to plant colonies on Mars and be an interplanetary species,” says Launius, “well, there are folks at NASA who believe you can’t say that with a straight face, that it rises to a giggle factor you can’t defend,” even if they dream about it. For NASA, commercial rocket companies like SpaceX are simply a cheaper, more reliable way to ensure access to the ISS for the next decade. And even that hasn’t come without an internal struggle, as old-line space apostles have argued that access to space must be a fundamental national priority and that only the U.S. government can be trusted to send humans, which Musk plans to do in the next three years. “There are people who are reluctant to look at commercial space, especially from the Apollo era,” says Lopez-Alegria, “and they say guys like Musk don’t know what they don’t know, and I want to agree―my whole life was spent in the government. But SpaceX and other companies are proving that hypothesis wrong.”<br><br>

For Musk, the NASA flights are the beginning of a crazy, colossal dream that he can build and launch so many rockets that they’ll become cheap, and as reliable as an airplane flight. “We need to launch multiple rockets a day and get the cost of going to Mars to about what a middle-class house in California costs now,” he says.<br><br>

Will that ever happen? Will Tesla ever rival General Motors and will Musk’s Falcon 9 pave the way to Mars and beyond? There’s no way to know, of course. Musk has to make and sell a lot of cars to a lot of fickle consumers. And even if he can send humans to space and launch a lot of rockets, that may not get us anywhere. “The fundamental challenge,” says Launius, “is to get to and from low-Earth orbit with some relative ease and with safe, reliable and less expensive methods. The more people who work on that problem the more likely we’ll solve it.”<br><br>

In the end, though, the biggest issue with making us interplanetary, Launius believes, isn’t even rocket technology but the biomedical issues of long-term living in a place with low gravity and high radiation. Even space missions of ten days have radical effects on the human body, including changes in muscle mass and bone density, “and figuring out how to solve that problem is profound,” says Launius. “What happens when you carry a child to term in one-sixth or one-third of the Earth’s gravity? We don’t even know the questions to ask.”<br><br>

Musk acknowledges those issues, but fiercely believes everything is solvable. “The goal of SpaceX has been to advance technology to create a self-sustaining colony on Mars. We have a long way to go and this is really hard work. It’s the most difficult thing humanity has ever done, but also the most interesting and inspiring. Do you want a future where you’re confined or reaching toward the stars? To me, the former is really depressing and I can’t wait to go. If I live 20 years, I think it’ll happen.”<br><br>

Musk gives a little nod, a trademark head bob that says that’s the way it is, and swivels back to his computer. It’s eight o’clock at night and up there, somewhere, his Dragon capsule is orbiting overhead. It’s time to tune out and return to Elon’s world.<br><br>

Elon Musk is the chief executive and lead designer of SpaceX C a US company developing space launch vehicles. Before founding SpaceX, he set up the Internet payment company PayPal, which was bought by eBay for $1.5bn in 2002.<br><br>	
  
Elon Musk<br><br>	

How did your interest in physics develop?<br><br>	
My father was an engineer so I grew up in a technical household, and physics was always what I was good at in school. I was also inspired by Richard Feynman's lectures and books. When I was 17, I moved from South Africa to Canada, and then to the University of Pennsylvania to study a dual degree in business and physics. It was an unusual combination, and I enjoyed the physics more. I'm not sure I would study business again if I could replay things.<br><br>	

How did your career progress from there?<br><br>	
I was offered a place at Stanford University to do postgraduate research into high-energy-density capacitors. But then the Internet came along, and I wanted a piece of the action. It's a common story C Google, Yahoo and several other firms were started by people who dropped out of their graduate programmes at Stanford. My first company, Zip2, provided online-publishing software for news organizations. Running a business is definitely stressful, especially managing lots of people. You don't really have to deal with those issues in physics C you can be an introvert and still do fine.<br><br>	

Do you think you were lucky to sell Zip2 and then PayPal for such large sums of money? It is unusual to win the lottery twice C from a physicist's standpoint, it is unlikely that luck was the only factor.<br><br>	

Why did you decide to start up a space firm?<br><br>	
I believe we have a duty to expand to other planets to preserve life against a natural or man-made calamity. With SpaceX, I'm hoping I can do as much as possible to further that goal. We're starting by developing a satellite launch vehicle that we hope will be 10 times cheaper than the current options. Although our first test launch last year failed, we learned a lot from it. We're currently getting ready for a second test launch and two more are scheduled for later this year. We're also developing vehicles that can carry crew C SpaceX won the contract from NASA to design and operate the successor to the Space Shuttle, which is very exciting.<br><br>	

How did you learn enough about rockets to be the lead designer for SpaceX?<br><br>	
I learn fast. But maybe it was my fault that the rocket blew up C that will teach me! What other projects are you working on? When I was in college, I decided that the three areas I would like to work on were the Internet, space exploration and clean energy. As well as SpaceX, I have an electric-car company called Tesla and another company called Solar City that designs and installs solar-power systems.<br><br>	

How has physics helped you in your career?<br><br>	
I think physics gives you a mental framework for problem solving. It also teaches you to be willing to admit you're wrong.<br><br>

Elon Musk<br><br>	
 
Why Physics?<br><br>	

It's What He Was Good At<br><br>	
 Elon was a geek. He grew up in a home that had foundations in engineering and science. When he was in school, physics was the one subject that he was always good at. In addition, Elon’s interest in physics was also inspired by Richard Feynman’s―a famous physicist―lectures and books.<br><br>	

It's Better Than Business<br><br>	
 While attending the University of Pennsylvania, Elon pursued a double major in physics and in business at the Wharton School. While his business education was excellent, Elon admits that he definitely preferred physics.<br><br>	

Using Physics<br><br>	

Changing the World Online<br><br>	
 An outspoken and highly intelligent entrepreneur, Elon is thought by some to be the personification of the Iron Man. You decide.<br><br>	

As a teenager, Elon knew that he wanted to work in areas concerning the Internet, space exploration, and clean energy. He began working as an entrepreneur with the Internet right after he graduated from college.<br><br>	

The Internet, space exploration, and clean energy are constantly changing and offer plenty of opportunities for new technology and business ventures. Two of his first ventures were Zip2, a commercial website hosting company, and PayPal, an online way to send and receive money.<br><br>	

 After starting Zip2 and PayPal, Elon sold them. He still wanted to create reliable and affordable technology for today’s changing society. Elon used the money from selling Zip2 and PayPal to explore his other interests: space and cars.<br><br>	
Space Exploration: To Infinity and Home Again<br><br>	
 Elon created SpaceX, a space transport company. SpaceX made significant innovations and advancements in getting things and people into space. SpaceX is innovative because it lowers the cost of space exploration while drawing more attention to the potential to make money in space companies.<br><br>	


SpaceX contracts with NASA are worth millions and millions of dollars. Elon has used his physics and business knowledge to run the company well. Not only does he manage the corporate matters of the company, but as the chief engineer for many of the company’s key projects, Elon also builds and designs many of the rockets and spacecraft.<br><br>	

 Initially, many people doubted that SpaceX would be successful and many critics were ready to focus on the company’s every mistake, but Elon has proven that there is a place for commercial space exploration and that his company can compete with corporations like Lockheed Martin and Boeing.<br><br>	

Electric Cars: Clean and Fast<br><br>	
 Meanwhile, Elon never let go of his interest in clean energy . . .<br><br>	

As well as starting and managing SpaceX, Elon began Tesla Motors, an electric car company. Primarily, Elon serves as Tesla's CEO and, as he does at SpaceX, he is active in overseeing the product design of all Tesla vehicles from start to end. Tesla Motors' cars are not only environmentally-friendly, but they are designed with sports car appeal.<br><br>	


Physics Plus<br><br>	
 With the skills and knowledge that he has gained from a physics education, his eye for design and innovation, and his business smarts, Elon is unique. In addition to his talents and gifts, he credits his work ethic, opinions, and education for his success.<br><br>	
Advice for Students<br><br>	

Use Your Interests to Start a Career<br><br>	
 Elon represents America’s true entrepreneurial spirit. He started businesses in areas that interested him. His fascination is what spurred his businesses.<br><br>	

Own Your Work<br><br>	
 Elon could’ve easily worked for Toyota or Lockheed Martin if he wanted to simply create hybrid technology or build spacecraft, but Elon wanted to be free to expand on his ideas and bring his designs to life. He knew that he had bold goals and groundbreaking ideas that couldn’t be fully accomplished unless he was making the decisions.<br><br>	

Make a Statement<br><br>	
 It’s not easy to run a company and oversee the design details of every single product, but Elon sees it more like he’s leaving his mark on the world through technological innovations.<br><br>	

Work Hard<br><br>	
 Many people were skeptical of his visions and ideas, but by not giving up, Elon has shown that his designs and technology are key innovations for this century and beyond.<br><br>	
Elon Musk is arguably the most innovative man in technology, or even the world. He's the founder of electric car company Tesla Motors, he's chairman of Solar City, and he created NASA rival SpaceX. <br><br>	

Who inspires the man who inspires everyone else?<br><br>	

Today at a big tech conference, South by Southwest, Elon Musk told thousands of listeners that he has great admiration for Benjamin Franklin, Winston Churchill, Sergey Brin, Larry Page, Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos.<br><br>	

"I've been inspired by a lot of historical figures," Musk said. "One of my favorite guys is Ben Franklin. He just thought about what are the problems that need to get solved and worked on those. He seemed like a good guy all around. I like historical figures in science and literature."<br><br>	

Next, Musk was asked for the best advice he's ever received.<br><br>	

Musk says it didn't come from a person. It came from studying physics.<br><br>	

"The physics training is very good training," he said. "It's a good framework for reasoning. You break things down to the most fundamental truths, and break them down to try and figure out what reality is. You have got have a framework for getting there. Quantum Mechanics is incredibly counter-intuitive, but it's true. It's a lot of advice, and it's the right framework."<br><br>	

Overall, Musk is a fan of critical thinking.<br><br>	

"Just in general, critical thinking is good," he said. "Does the logic connect? What are the range of probably outcomes? You want to figure out what those probabilities are and ideally be the House. It's fine to gamble, as long as you're the House. Also, listen to critical feedback, particularly from friends. Generally they will be thinking it but they won't tell you."<br><br>	

Elon Musk's Business Ideas Start With The Laws Of Physics<br><br>	

 TED curator Chris Andersen interviewed SpaceX CEO and Tesla founder Elon Musk yesterday at the organization's Long Beach conference. In the interview, summarized in a blog post at the TED website, Musk offered three pieces of advice for people looking to innovate.<br><br>	

The first is pretty standard, you have to "work a lot."<br><br>	

The second is to "study physics and learn how to reason from first principles rather than reason by analogy."<br><br>	

That actually reveals a great deal about why he's started the businesses he has. In many ways, they're responses to the laws of physics. Here's how Musk explains what he's trying to do with Tesla:<br><br>	

“All modes of transport will become electric, with the ironic exception of rockets. There’s no way around Newton’s third law,” he says. “So the question is how you create a really energy efficient car.”<br><br>	

Tesla cars are incredibly light because of their aluminum chassis. Though the cars have some issues now, the shift towards electric vehicles is likely inevitable in the long run. SolarCity was founded with a similar idea in mind, that having sustainable energy is essential to mankind's survival. By making solar power more widespread, Tesla owners won't have to depend on utilities. <br><br>	

“I’m confident solar will beat everything hands down, including natural gas. If it doesn’t, we’re in deep trouble,” Musk said.<br><br>	

And SpaceX is built off the idea that unless mankind starts living on other planets, we're condemning ourselves to inevitable extinction. All reasoning from first principles.   <br><br>	

His final piece of advice? To listen to negative feedback, especially when it comes from friends.  It may sound simple, Musk said, but people rarely do it.<br><br>	

 
Science Fiction Books That Inspired Elon Musk<br><br>	

By Jason Boog on March 19, 2013 <br><br>	

At the relaunch event for KCRW’s Design & Architecture (DnA) show this week, Tesla Motors and PayPal co-founder Elon Musk answered questions about his work.<br><br>	

During his interview with DnA host Frances Anderton, the SpaceX founder said that science fiction had inspired his wide-ranging career. Naturally, this GalleyCat editor asked what books inspired the entrepreneur. Musk gave a long answer:<br><br>	


In terms of sci-fi books, I think Isaac Asimov is really great. I like the Foundation series, probably one of the all-time best. Robert Heinlein, obviously. I like The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress and I like Stranger in a Strange Land, although it kind of goes off the rails at the end.<br><br>	



He also shared recommendations for aspiring engineers:<br><br>	


There’s a good book on structural design called Structures: Or Why Things Don’t Fall Down. It is really, really good if you want a primer on structural design. There is a good book on rocket stuff called Ignition! [An informal history of liquid rocket propellants] by John Clark, that’s a really fun one.<br><br>	

Musk concluded with more science fiction favorites:<br><br>	


Obviously, I am a huge fan of Star Wars and Star Trek, all the things you would expect. I like Dark City, that’s a good one but doesn’t get much play. I’ve read a zillion, and, of course, A Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.<br><br>
